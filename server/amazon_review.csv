0,Amit,2018-10-20,"Good speaker, Bad software","This is very good hardware and speaker. However very much handicapped by amazon on software front. It can not understand your commands 70-80 percentage times and very limited to amazon music and saavn. However you can not use any of good music apps like wynk, gaana, youtube etc.Also natural language processing is supported in google products but not in this echo.For example when you say-1) where is agra - it gives you correct answer.2) continue with next query like how to reach there ?Then for 2nd query it doesn't know what to do..This is just an example but most of the times you will find this issue there.Then you can not connect with other populer music etc apps. Have to rely on what amazon thinks os good for you.Amazon music has very limited music base.So looking forward to get more access and integration with alexa however not have much hope since its already such an old plateform that they would have given support if there were any such plans.",2756,3
1,Parag,2018-10-19,Very poor sound recognition.,"It definitely has better speakers than Eco Dot Gen2 and Google Home Mini, but sound recognition is very poor compared to Google Home Mini or even previous Eco Dot. Maybe it has something to do with cost cutting and Amazon going with only 4 far field microphones instead of 7.But due to it's poor recognition, it takes a lot of time, sometimes even minutes and does nothing... Which definitely takes away the experience. Unfortunately I can't return it... But I think Google Home Mini is miles ahead and better with all the new updates to Google Assistant (Sleep assist and stuff).Update as on 27th April 2019: Software has gone from bad to worst. It plays certain songs again and again, doesn't let you skip. Recognition has also gone from bad to worst, you have to yell for Alexa to understand what you want it to do only for it to tell you it doesn't understand what you said. And expect no support from Amazon about eco devices, it's very bad.",1895,1
2,Chinmaya D.,2018-10-15,My first Smart Speaker,This was launched on 11th and I got the product by 12th. Plus the reduced price due to sale and a nice smart bulb for just 500 rupees. Overall I think this was super value for money. I haven't used any other smart speaker before but I am very happy with my purchase. Below are some observations :1. Initially it feels a bit weird talking to a speaker but you get used to it in no time.2. The sound quality is pretty good. You get good depth of sound with decent bass.3. Several skills available and you will definitely find some very useful. For example adding stuff to shopping list or setting up a reminder.4. Understands the Indian accent very well. Sometimes I am amazed by how well it picks up stuff.6. Kids love it. An added advantage is that they can take help for homework and talking to alexa also motivates them to talk in English,2612,5
3,Vishnu,2018-12-22,it’s amazing just read my review,"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
  Such an amazing product it responds from where ever I call it from my room . It does slow down when my data internet is over its just amazing . It does play all musics from all languages it can tell jokes ,can turn lights tv etc on or off. It can speak and understand Hindi and EnglishIt plays all songs I have tried Telugu English and HindiIt does play what ever songs you wantAnd it can roast you or your friend anyoneYou can even call through thatI just love it",653,5
4,Rajiv p.,2018-10-15,Stunner!,It's totally Paisa wasoolSpeaker is loudShe listen well to your commandI'm amazed with it music quality even when paired with mobile it plays loud but struggling to make a callHapppy me !,635,4
5,Geetha Swapnika Duggineni,2018-11-19,Worst software. I'm totally disappointed with Alexa.,"Worst software!!! Not even 50% of answers were matched to my questions. Ask anything, it says I'm not sure about that. Not even songs are playing as per my command. After every song it stops. It's not going to the next one. For every command we need to say Alexa. Only advantage with this product is it have a great bass. Waste of money.I asked about today's news and it has the same answer - Sorry, I don't know about what you are asking.OK Google is far far far better than Alexa.Wanna share one funny moment with Alexa...I asked her to tell me about routers and switches and she started telling about sandwich... 😵",284,1
6,Aritra Daspoddar,2019-02-19,A real competition to Google Home mini,"At first i was confused which one to buy - Google home mini or Echo dot. After considering few factors I decided to buy this echo dot 3rd gen.Pros:1) Sound quality and volume has improved a lot from previous gen.2) Alexa and Amazon services are more integrated with Indian market which the Google lacks. For example I can book uber cab,order food in zomato,order things from Amazon without even taking out my smartphone.3) It can used as a smart speaker,Bluetooth speaker and also it has 3.5 mm headphone jack.4) Amazon prime membership at Rs 999 per year is the most value for money subscription. You can stream in Amazon prime video, music from prime music, become an Amazon prime member, free kindle e books and many more.Google takes monthly Rs 99 for songs only.5) You can control smart lights and electronics from Philips, Xiaomi, Yeelight and other Alexa compatible devices.Cons:1) Let me be honest,Alexa can never beat Google assistant, Never(That's why I gave 4 stars)2) It has to be kept plugged in all the time,not battery powered (same is the case with Google home)So if you are looking for a smarter assistant to interact with, Google home is your choice. For all other uses Amazon echo speakers are better.",212,4
7,FiveMinutesOfAdi,2018-10-26,"Finally, a smart ""speaker""","I got it on sale for 3k. For the price, it offers decent sound and richer bass, compared to my much cheaper, 1.5k Bluetooth speaker, the Boat Stone 260. It works seemlessly with my smart home devices, and the app is fantastic. It yet doesn't have support with fire TV stick, but Amazon assures it'll arrive by mid-november, so that's something to look out for. The app works great, and you can control your smart home or this dot from anywhere in the world, as long both of your devices have an internet connection. It's a fun little party trick, really. I couldn't be more happier with my echo dot. Also, as you can see in the picture, I got the sophisticated looking white color ;)Edit: It has fire TV support now, it's not the best experience, but hey - it WORKS.",142,5
8,Rimple Sethi,2018-10-21,Good music player but poor assistant,Rate of speech cannot be altered. Specially in bedtime stories. Children don't understand the fast English.Accent is pathetic.Kids can't understand the accent.It's a good music player but poor assistant.Many a times the MIC doesn work.The biggest problem is the search. criteria.  There is a lot of information which is on google that it deliberately does not pick.  It searches only from amazon search engine/wikipedia.,132,2
9,Amrish,2018-10-15,it does not support fire TV,"This device does not have integration with Fire TV in INDIA ONLY !!.  So, if you don't have smart plug and smart switches then only thing you can do with this device is play music. not worth paying 3000 for getting voice command support for playing music only.",113,1
10,Sonu,2018-11-13,Best at what it does..,"Presently there are two major competitors for smart speakers in India i.e., Amazon echo dot and Google home mini. I am user of both. Trust me Amazon echo has nailed their product by this 3rd generation upgrade.->Beautiful modern look with good sound and super microphone sensitivity. Google home with its 2 microphone is far behind on picking user command especially when music is on as compared to alexa(4 microphones). So hardware wise Echo dot(3rd gen) is clearly winner with louder sound, better bass and better microphone sensitivity.->Alexa response time is faster plus it hears me out in most of noisy situations. I literally have to shout to google home sometimes.->Music listening experience is breeze on alexa with prime account. Amazon music is tailored made for India having songs and playlist for festival occasions. Google music doesn't have festival playlist. Google music team doesn't pay heed to Indian festivals and occasions. I couldn't find diwali playlist on Google Music(being a pro member). Moreover Alexa is quick on catching keywords whereas Google is slow and sometimes unable to catch keywords. Moreover google home interaction with gaana and saavn is not perfect. It doesn't able to find songs many times even if song is there on Gaana(being pro user).->Google home is better for continued conversations because it knows context but I think conversation with these devices dies out after few days of excitement. And then you only use these for doing daily jobs- playing news, songs, reminders, questions and answers, alarms in which alexa is better(due to its hardware advantage). Although I wish Amazon add context conversation to Alexa along with voice profile feature(multi user voice recognition) which is present on Google home.->Google home has one major advantage that it supports hindi language(commands and response). I wish Amazon add this feature to alexa.->Lastly Alexa has vast collection of skills in India- playing radio stations, flight search and price(cleartrip integration), zomato restuarant suggestion and food ordering, ola and uber cab booking, railways pnr enquiry and train availability, hindi jokes(better than on google home), meditation, exercise, devotional songs, and many more. Google home is lacking on many of these useful skills like flight search and price, ola, uber, zomato,radio stations, train availability, etc.->Alexa integration with amazon firestick is on its way according to Alexa Indian team. So it is an useful addition of feature for those who have amazon firestick.Conclusion->If you are a prime user, Amazon echo dot is the best choice for you among all competitors. If you are buying for your family or someone else not comfortable with english, then Google home is your only choice right now(as it supports hindi language).UPDATE!!!-> Amazon has brought in much requested contextual conversation and continued conversation feature to Alexa like in Google home known as ""Follow-Up Mode"" which can be enabled from settings.",95,5
11,Sharpbhushan,2018-11-10,it's a worth buying,"I bought 3rd gen Echo Dot.... here are some pros and cons:Pro's.1. Great improvement in sound quality when compared to the 2nd generation DOT.2. Alexa understands Indian accent well and the one sold here is customized only for India.3. Design and build quality is very good. I liked the fabric design over the plastic on the 2nd gen DOT4. Just say what you want to buy from Amazon and it will purchase/add it to your cart. Alexa will buy it provided you have given her permissions, it can be controlled using Alexa app on your mobile.5. You can make her connect to a bigger speaker using bluetooth or Aux for better quality sound.6. Alexa can play songs of your choice from Amazon prime music as well as Tune-in radio. You can enable other radio stations aswell.7. The best part of Alexa is that she can set reminders, to do lists and Alarms. She can set multiple alarms and reminders.8. You can ask her any random questions, calculations, general knowledge etc.Cons.1. You need Amazon prime subscription to search and play for songs. I won't recommend Echo to anyone without Prime subscription.Over all I'm happy with Alexa. She is a good smart companion. Alexa is intelligent and there are lot of things you can do, just some spent time with her and you will be amazed. Amazon will be enabling Alexa with more skills, it's a worth buying.....",87,5

13,Gems,2019-10-04,Google is infinitely better,"Even the best devices can be ruined by poor software and bad UI. This is a classic case of a good device such as the Echo dot 3rd gen let down by horrendous software. In terms of sheer sound quality and ability to hear you across the room, the ED 3rd blows google home mini right out of the water, and... that's where it stops.I bought it for 2299 and got a wipro bulb free, I figured that it couldn't be a bad purchase. Boy was I wrong!Let's begin with the Alexa app, whoever is in charge of making that app should be sent back to 2012. Remember when you had no clue whether you tapped on a button or not because the taps weren't highlighted? Remember how everything used to be unresponsive back then? Yeah, that's Alexa app for you. SD 855 and 8gigs of ram on your phone? LoL, Alexa don't care! The layout, the buttons in the app, the navigation, ugh.. takes me back to the 90's. A big zero on ease of use or navigational hierarchy. Forget Grandpa, even millennials would have a hard time with this app!What about voice recognition? 50% of the time, it does not recognize you every time.Smartness: The lack of smartness is displayed when you start asking follow up questions. ""Who is the tallest man?"" It'll give you the answer, but if you follow up with ""how tall is he?"". Alexa will go berserk. Heralding a device that can control your lights or turn on the TV as a miraculous achievement is a blatant lie. Controls via commands is nothing new, people in the coding community have done so with raspberry pi's before. What makes it smart is the incousion of AI and machine learning that understands patters and recognizes speech slurs. Something google does and constantly thrives to improve upon.Microphones: There are 4 and they are good, they can hear you from 10 feet away under normal circumstances. Far better than Goggle home mini.Connectivity issues: Wuff, this is one of the biggest issues I faced. Connection is not as easy and simple as that 3 slide image says on the description. Turn on Bluetooth, location, wifi, then look at the app for a Echo-something-th8, it didn't show up! Great, now do the manual labour and get it connected. Even after connection you're gonna get ""updating your device for 10 minutes"".Integration with other smart devices: Wanna connect the wipro bulb with Alexa? First download the wipro smart home app, create an account so that you can be spammed for the rest of your life, then set up that app and device. Next, head over to Alexa, download the wipro skill app for alexa, set it up and congratulations, you can now control lights with latency issues rivaling that of a 56k modem. What's worse, I now have an app on my phone that I only used once in my life but cannot for the love of god uninstall because that stops the bulb from working. VERY SMART!Music: Wanna listen to music on this speaker from your favorite streaming service? Unless it's Amazon music, Saavn or iTunes, your sh!t our of luck. Even though Spotify launched nearly a year ago, there's no way to get Spotify playing on the device natively unless you change device region to Amerika.Speed: You can stream Netflix at 4k? That's great, Alexa don't care! Ask a question, go brew a coffee, fix that leaking faucet, sign up for a banking loan and then, only then perhaps you would get your answer. Now that's an exaggeration but when you compare Alexa's speed in terms of genuine questions as opposed to responding to commands like ""turn off the light"", it is the slowest. Google>Siri>Cortana>your neighbor's pigeon >Alexa.I could go on, but I'll stop here and sulk myself with buyer's remorse.",61,1
14,Anoop varghese,2018-12-02,Waste product,"Waste item,nothing free ,if we will ask to play one song means alexa will tell you should subscribe amazon prime.only weather will come freely.no inbuilt battery, no power means no alarm completely waste product.why you should spend  money unnecessary to this waste product.they wont give at least one month free prime membership also ...",68,1
15,Ramkumar R,2018-11-07,"Bought it once, Will Buy it Again and Again","1) Firstly, you may be confused whether to buy Google Home or Alexa. If you are an Amazon Prime customer, the choice is a no-brainer because you get Amazon Music for free as well as tight integration with Amazon Products.2) The sound produced by this device is good for filling one bedroom with rich sound. Arijit Singh never sounded so deep :).3) The microphone is super sensitive. You can even whisper ""Alexa"" and the device will pick it up.4) The Alexa skills available are amazing which can be turned on through the companion app. Few skills you should try are  4.1) Radio tuning=> Just say Alexa Play Radiocity. Get back into the radio habit.  4.2) For the religious => Just say Alexa wake me up at 6 AM to Suprabhatam. Done deal.  4.3) For the romantic => Just say Alexa open Love Shayari. Ghalib at your finger tips.  4.4) Want a multiplayer quiz fight => Just say Alexa QuizMaster. You will be playing it at 10 AM.  4.5 ) Interactive Stories for Kids => Just say Alexa MagicDoor.  4.6) Apps by Magoosh to build vocabulary are awesome.5) Alexa can calculate, tell you the calories in an egg, convert feet to inches and all the regular things.6) The most useful features  6.1) Alexa add milk to shopping list. Viola! milk is added as a list item in the shopping list on your app. Very useful for my wife.  6.2) Drop In using your Alexa App to talk to people at home. Very useful.7) Setting Alexa up is a breeze and since she is cloud based the intelligence keeps improving.Alexa has thoroughly impressed my family and now everyone wants one for their room. Waiting for the next sale.",62,5
16,Vikas Singh,2020-08-04,Not that useful,"I purchased this as a birthday gift for my 7 years old son. Since he don't have siblings so I though it would be a fun experience for him talking to and giving commands to alexa. But to my dismay he only used it for playing music that also only one song after one month of his birthday. ""Alexa please play the flying jat song"". There were things I demonstrated him about alexa like jungle quiz, panchtantra ki kahaniya, alexa laugh, beatbox, fart!  Etc. But after one month of use he lost interest in it and being powered from socket I am also not interested to use it as a bluetooth speaker. I configured it to control a wipro smart bulb. But after few days  I started using the smart bulb as a regular bulb because it's easier to press the physical switch compared to checking the configuration & connection everytime ""Alexa Bulb on"" or ""Alexa bulb off"" voice command doesn't work. So now it is kept idle since 3 months and will remain so for many more months/years to come. The bottomline is that alexa is not that useful as advertised and we tend to lose interest in it very quickly.",36,3
17,KANASU,2018-11-03,DIFFICULT TO INSTAL Now OK after tech support by a well Trained personnel,"BEFORE PURCHASE IT WAS NOT CLEAR WHETHER I NEED 2 MOBILES OR 1 LAPTOP OR 1 PC TO INSTAL .I HAVE BEEN TRYING TO INSTAL SINCE 3 DAYS USING MY 2 MOBILES....

THE TEAM IS ASKING ME TO INSTAL THROUGH LAPTOP OR PC..  It can be installed with one mobile. Suggestions for improvement in hardware : The 4 buttons on the Echo should made ro glow with LED. Now you have to search buttons using a torch or mobile torch . All the programs in Menu  Skill & Games should be pre-enabled, it's hectic to enable more than 75 programs/functions.

22,BhaveshB.O.T™,2019-07-21,Amazon's entry-level Echo is still one of its best 😍,"Verdict-While the previous Echo Dots were cheap ways to extend smart home control all over your home, they weren't the most attractive devices and had weedy sounds. Bought it on tha second day of Prime day in a combo-The Amazon Echo Dot (3rd Gen) as a vast improvement on the originals, even though it costs exactly the same.-The new finish looks fantastic and the new Echo Dot is a device that you'd happily put out on show. Audio has been dramatically improved, too, both in terms of quality and loudness, which makes Alexa easier to understand and means that the odd bit of music or radio is a possibility.-If you're looking to put Alexa in more rooms, then this is the device to buy.Pros-Clear and loud audio-3.5mm and Bluetooth audio outputs-Same price as old model-Improved designCons-No longer USB-powered-Not ideal for music",26,4

25,Secret Senpai,2019-05-20,A BIG NO,"I am writing about my genuine experience. I have Google home mini and I built an Attic so I thought why not buy another smart system like Amazon echo 3 but it was my mistake to buy it,like whenever I asked little complicated questions it says sorry I don't know it and whenever I say you're useless it also says sorry I don't know about that also, it sounds little better than Google home mini and also catches microphone sound little better but what's the point if it can answer what you ask for, if you want to listen songs you have to you have prime membership otherwise you can't listen songs so I did not have any prime membership and I have to pay 999 for that just listen songs, 8 out of 10 times it fails to answer your questions so it will get to your nearv pretty quickly,if you have low temper then you can buy it, my only advice is use your hard earned money properly and buy a Google home mini it will never disappoint you, like never",23,1
26,Vijay Kumar,2019-10-12,Amazon is selling an experimental product.,"Before buying this product please keep these points in mind:- You need amazon prime account  for Rs. 999 per year to listen to music from amazon. Otherwise you will have to use free and full of advertisement services like Saavn, Gaana, etc.- Echo dot skips to next song abruptly without completing current song most often.- If you try to stream music from your Amazon Prime Music app on your iPhone to Echo Dot or Echo Dot stereo pair, the app cannot control the music. You cannot scrub music or know which song is playing or move to next music in the playlist. The control magically switches the Alexa app that you need to have on your phone to setup Echo dot.- You can only stream to stereo pair from Amazon Prime Music App.- No real support exists for this device. If you call amazon support staff, they will drive you crazy as they know nothing about this product and its features.- If you want to use it as kids toy, then it is ok to buy it as it can switch on and off lights that are compatible with Alexa.- Audio quality is very basic. Even a cheap Chinese product sounds better.- This is really a no no product for music lovers. You better buy either Sony or JBL soundbars with subwoofer for better quality music, though these may cost you beyond INR15k.- Alexa does not understands most of the commands. Apple Siri is way ahead of Alexa.- Amazon is not a software and hardware company. Don't expect quality software  and hardware from them. You are being used as testers for their experimental products.",16,1

28,jereenalex,2018-10-16,Alexa is smart and intelligent,"So I got the 3rd generation Echo Dot during Amazon great Indian sale. I had actually tested the 2nd generation Echo Dot and Echo few months back and was not that impressed with the sound quality, the 2nd Gen Dot was hopeless. Let me put down the pro's and con's of the 3rd generation Echo DotPro's.1. Great improvement in sound quality when compared to the 2nd generation DOT.2. Alexa understands Indian accent well and the one sold here is customized only for India.3. You can enable lot of skills. Skills are like apps created by third party developer, you just need to enable them based on your requirement.4. Smart home features works very well. I love controlling lights with Alexa.5. Design and build quality is very good. I liked the fabric design over the plastic on the 2nd gen DOT6. Just say what you want to buy from Amazon and it will purchase/add it to your cart. Alexa will buy it provided you have given her permissions, it can be controlled using Alexa app on your mobile.7. You can make her connect to a bigger speaker using bluetooth or Aux for better quality sound.8. Alexa can play songs of your choice from Amazon prime music as well as Tune-in radio. You can enable other radio stations aswell.9. The best part of Alexa is that she can set reminders, to do lists and Alarms. She can set multiple alarms and reminders.10. You can ask her any random questions, calculations, general knowledge etc.Cons.1. Alexa can place order for you from Amazon but you gotta be very specific. Let's say you asked Alexa to buy a T Shirt, she doesn't give you options on the color or size. If you give specific details in the first command, then she will place the correct one in the cart but it's not easy. She is only good to order groceries from Amazon.2. I found some bugs with her, sometimes she asks me to try the command after a while. She rebooted once when she was not able to process the command. Also I found issues when using certain skills. I'm sure Amazon will fix those issues.3. Audio quality is good but not great. I know that she is not just a speaker, but clarity could have improved when listening to music. Connect to a bigger speaker with AUX or bluetooth if you're not satisfied with sound quality. Please don't compare Dot with JBL or similar, I've seen it in few reviews. If you're an audiophile and want excellent sound quality, then don't look at the Echo range of products.4. You need Amazon prime subscription to search and play for songs. I won't recommend Echo to anyone without Prime subscription.Over all I'm happy with Alexa. She is a good smart companion. Alexa is intelligent and there are lot of things you can do, just some spent time with her and you will be amazed. Amazon will be enabling Alexa with more skills, it's a worth buy when compared to Google Home.",262,5

30,PANKAJ PATIL,2019-02-19,Cumbersome and not at all user friendly,Why the single star...I am about practicality... it's not easy to configure alexa...very cumbersome process...Alexa app is quite slow...once configured to a wifi network...you cannot really configure to any other wifi...which means Alexa cannot be taken to other places other than your home. Commands cannot be configured easily. No way to configure your playlist. A playlist that exists in Amazon or Saavn is pathetic. No proper way to configure or use wifi that is available in public or your vacation places. The continuous power supply is required. Please don't waste your money on this better get Jarvis or wait till this improves a lot,16,1
31,Mathematech,2018-11-04,Disappointed due to change in power cable type,"Its really made the new device compared to the old model, less compatible. It has changed the power port from Standard most common microUSB to a very non-standard one. Which means, portability from one spot in the room to another or taking it to another room has been majorly compromised. Even worse, the power cable is attached permanently, not via a USB socketM guessing because its a 15W charger, its probably to force users to use the provided charger only",16,3

Even if they fall or are in any emergency they can still call me and I can check in on them regularly with the drop in feature.It can also read them the bible and play them the songs they want, lets them check on the cricket score from bed and it can answer most of the trivia question they throw at it.",16,5
33,Ramesh M,2019-06-24,Another Lady at home,"I have a Google Home (her name is RoseDay) and Echo Dot (paired with Alexa) is the new Lady at home.RoseDay is a little Smarter, but Alexa isn't far behind. I have kept Alexa running non stop for a week while we were away for a tour abroad, and i must say, she has done a good job with the tasks assigned to her. . I could control her remotely from my mobile from 1000s of KM away and was able to watch her switch on our smart lights, show us our house using smart CCTV Cameras, play songs at home at random times(i do it just to give a feeling that people are at home even when away). Alexa packs more features for the Echo Dot  than RoseDay (google home). I purchased two Alexa's (as if one wasn't enough) and gifted one to my mom who stays at a different place than we do, so she could speak to my daugther just using the Echo dots.Overall, Alexa (Echo Dot) is one (talkative) little lady of your choice, that your wife will be happily willing to accept to be home.",9,4
34,ARNPRASAD,2020-08-07,Combo with smart bulb reaches US deal price!!!!,For 2000 using 10% off..you are getting a bulb worth 500...making echo dot 1500 which at roughly 20 dollars is same price you get in deals in USA.  So no more asking friends to get them from there!!!!  Anyone sitting on the fence can buy this instead of buying bluetooth speakers.  This is 5th Echo dot including earlier versions and Google Mini doesnt even come close when it comes to smartness.  While Google mini answers google search questions better - no one is buying a smart speaker for that.  Its integration with smart devices is unparalled and my mini appears dumb most of the times.  Just grab this before it goes back to its old price.  Even the smart bulb is very helpful.  While watching TV..just ask Alexa to turn bulb blue or red!! Not sure if this bulb can dim...if so..you can use this both as a day bulb and a night bulb.  Just go for it before its too late,6,5

36,Shahab.,2019-02-15,Superbly over-promised and hugely underperforming electronic equipment.,"Extremely overstated product in ads and otherwise. Has bare minimum that it can do as it has only prime music as a source of music. Doesn't understand most of the commands and doesn't have a huge number of songs which are very common, this makes choices extremely limited! Pairing is a serious pain on most occasions and thus isn't much user friendly either. Came free as a result of card usage else would have been hurting like anything. I feel Google speakers would be much better considering it's search is based on what's there on the internet rather than a perticular site or app! Using an android I know what Google assistant is capable off as compared to baby dumb Alexa!",13,1
37,Tausif,2019-09-30,"Mine is Ruined One, Hope you got better one","I  have to shout literally on this to activate this little mad speaker. Worked well for one month, now, sound quality is pathetic, lots of distortion, speaker is vibrating during playing of high notes. And about Bluetooth connection with other devices (smartphones) is just pathetic, no doubt it will connect fast but what's the use of you see lots of Audio lag while playing videos, also if you use it as a Bluetooth speaker then you're gone guys, low sound output and bass is not that much good.Note: before one month speaker quality is good and bass is punchy if you play online song by activating Alexa. But after a month with minimal usage, speaker sound is just pathetic, chik chik sound is coming while playing high notes.I am planning to ask Amazon for the replacement, let's see that experience and I'll update it if they replace this pathetic product.",9,1
38,Shopper!!!,2019-04-15,Alexa is better than human being! Best buy ever!,"It's true that Alexa could more than just a simple voice assistant that plays music on your request.It listens to anything you say and answers smartly. Alexa got an attitude which is quite amazing.Siri, Cortana, and other voice assistants are no match for Alexa.  Alexa acts better than Google in terms of finding information.It can almost answer to any anything whether your question related to history,  IPL cricket scores or mythology. Alexa answers all of them with details.You can literally have a conversation with her and she is a great distraction when you're really tired of talking to real people.The money you spend on this device is definitely worth its value and time.the only negative I have is that you have to connect the dot to the power source.

And in comes this girl. I taught the basics to my mom and now she gets most of her favourite songs by just naming them!Her additional function of playing an assistant is also cool, from reading out the news, telling the time, setting reminders/alarms/timers, notes, making grocery lists, cooking recipes, and answering general questions; she is for keeps.Thanks Amazon, for introducing my family to the smart life. We are getting lazy :DPoint to note... All these services are enjoyed if you are an Amazon Prime customer.

41,Jake,2018-11-01,GOOD SOUND QUALITY FOR IT'S SIZE,"All new ECHO DOT THIRD GEN looks compact but the sound quality is amazing for its size. After using it for nearly two weeks the following are it's pros and cons:PROS:1. ) Compact and relatively easy to setup.Check out the YouTube videos in case of doubt or look up Product HELP.2.) Once the product is synchronised with the Alexa app  on your mobile ,it retains its memory even if the power fails, though it has no battery back up. Alexa on the cloud retains it's memory. !!3.) Amazing sound quality for it's size. Good treble and bass.4.) The new rounded look with fabric finish is pleasing to the eye.5.) Can be used as an alarm clock and reminder for frequent travelers provided your hotel has free WiFi and good power back up.CONS :1.) No battery back up .2.) Has not been programmed for Indian Railway and bus schedules. Programming, I am told is an ongoing process.",12,3
42,Ajit Kumar,2019-07-14,Affordable Smart Speaker : Intelligent and Smart,"Amazon Echo Dot ticks all the boxes, except it's sound quality. It's extremely powerful, smart and agile. The effort by the engineer's at Amazon shows. They have done a painstaking job to perfect Alexa. Microphones are powerful (Alexa even acted upon a request to play party music from a TV commercial!!). The sound quality needs to be worked upon. It's just not there. Considering that most of my requests are to play music, it needs to be crystal clear. It's not that small speakers can't sound good. JBL, for instance, sounds great even in its basic version. I  had to invest in an extra Bluetooth speaker to make up the deficiency on the sound quality front ( Ultimate Ears Wonderboom costing Rs 4 k). Incidentally, I  had a tough time searching for a compatible Bluetooth speaker as Amazon has not released any list of Echo Dot compatible speakers. I  had made a call to Echo support and even the support executive could not help me. Finally after two cancellations, I  hit upon Wonderboom, which is terrific with the Echo Dot.",8,4

When I specially say 'Alexa play telugu retro station songs' it is playing old songs of specific combination of male and female singers.I will update the review after days again but it's 5 star rating for now",6,5
44,Abhinav Jaiswal,2018-10-31,Great Product....!!,I had been using the echo dot 2nd generation for some time now and was quite pleased with it. So when they launched the 3rd generation echo dot with better speakers and multiple mikes i wasn't hesitant. I was not surprised at all as it lived upto my expectations and to some extent exceeded them. The speakers are much louder and better as compared to the earlier generation and may be the listening capacity is also better. To top all this they have also made it much better looking with the fabric finish on the sides.,11,5

But only works with Power socket, not chargeable one😒.Usage - It connects with your phone easily, it could recognise your voice easily. But it can only answer very easy and familier queations. Appart from that it will always say like ""sorry I don't know that one""😵. And each time you need to start conversations by saying Alexa, then only it will start recognise your commend. Within few minutes you will get a headache🤕.Music - When you say Alexa play music, their will play music from Hungama app. Very less collection is there. Especially Tamil songs are very very less. And mostly Alexa not playing the song which you ask. It will play on it's won. 🥴Finally - Good initiative from Amazon but needs of improvement.

It has a really good voice range in both senses- the speaker in its full is pretty powerful plus Alexa manages to hear you even from the next room. Not good with regional languages though. Still learning i guess. Plus sometimes shows some glitches in responding especially if you are requesting something like a hindi song and can sometimes not tell you the desired information. But that hapoens rarely. Overall, happy with the device after 10 days of usage.",10,4

You get held up during installation but Amazon has given explanations for specific problems. Plus there is some thing called skill set which gives the eco dot infinite skills.

52,Bhaggs√,2019-03-01,Not that impressed,"Sadly, I had to return it. It felt like a speaker eventually. Nothing to add, Everything felt very processed, I had to ask Alexa  one thing and she keeps replying I don't know that. Its kind of very irritating at times. Only my 5yrs old daughter was interested and wide eyed when Alexa spoke. lolI will start with Cons--You need to keep it plugged as it has no supportive battery.You need to keep repeating question like a parrot until Alexa understandsYou need to keep adding apps for alexa to function and that too does not work properlyAlexa does not recognise your playlist, Its not programmed that way, So even if your have list full of songs it will not play.Alexa only knows Savan and Amazon music which has very limited collection of songs.Now comes for the storytelling and other activities, It keeps repeating the same story and same jokes, same poems. BORINGI could have gone on and on but then I returned it as I felt it does practically nothing other than rubbish.Pros-- Anticipation of something awesome... hahhahahhaThe cute buildI wish they upgrade more and make it more usable.",7,2

54,Prakash,2018-11-19,Alexa - better than Siri or Cortana,"As an Alexa equipped Personal Assistant , Amazon Dot is incredible. I am using Siri in my iPhone and Cortana in my Windows Desktop. Compared with them, Alexa is far better. It gives crisp answers in multiple sentences and not one cryptic line. For example, ask her about the weather and she tells you about the weather in many sentences - temperature, humidity and the probability of rain. When asked the same question in Siri or Cortana - they say only the temperature - at least in my case.The Bluetooth Speaker barely consumes about 3 W and the consumption rises when used at high volumes. It is crystal clear. The only crib is its Bass response is a shade poorer. Not much of an issue as it uses a tiny speaker. So don't expect a rich full blooded sound from it.I am using this to control Sonoff Wifi Switches for my Home automation and it is wonderful to control all your devices with just your voice.At the end of the day, it is money well spent over a useful gadget.",8,5
55,shasha,2019-06-19,"3rd generation alexa, the creator has lost his touch by making it more like boom box","Alexa is really good but once you start copying someone you loose your originals and same has happened with 3rd generation alexa, the creator has lost his touch by making it a boom box instead more of an assistant she is now lazy wakes up bit late, you need to be bit louder now, and as like Google mini she cannot listen if the volume is above 6 or 7, I have not understood why they copied the Googles harsh sound decibles ( that's why I am not using Google I have) and brought 2 old Alexa and now 2 new Alexa even the earlier Alexa has become bit lazy may be it's the upgrade for 3rd generation alexa has caused the lazyness. Otherwise Alexa is way superior to Google mini , I request the creator to stick to your own ideas and not to be preconceived with any opinion",6,3
56,Soumyodip K.,2020-11-06,Imperfectly perfect!,"I was in doubt while choosing between Google home mini and Echo dot but my inclination towards Amazon as a prime member and my investment into Amazon eco-system made me convinced that I should choose alexa over the other.Packaging was very good and it contained the Echo dot and and its proprietary charger.The Echo dot is built well with its mesh fabric design which looks good. It has volume up/down, set-up button with a nifty mute button. It has an ever convenient aux port for connecting to audio system which itself is a reason for my purchase. It can also connect with Bluetooth.Set-up was easy with the Alexa app and there a plethora of skills to try out.Sound was warm and the volume could be room filling. As expected there isn't enough bass but other than that the sound is good. Voice recognition is good and it may miss low voices. The Alexa voice is itself is like a person which is good and adds a personality to it. It can sometimes give very witty contextual answers. It's best used with Amazon products and generally good. Home automation is an area where it has an edge as most of the smart home products are Alexa compatible and generally speaking Alexa is best suited for Indian scene. I can stream high quality music from Amazon music being a prime member to my sound system and have added convenience of a smart speaker. You can find good deals and bundles at festivities if you are planning to purchase it.",3,5

58,anil,2018-10-21,Not a great quality speaker and can't be used in a car,"I thought this could be used in our car as well.. but few feature does not allow it to be used so.. 1). It uses 15 volt power.. while car battery provides 12 volt power.. don't know if the car battery can support the power requirement.. 2). Probably,  the power lead that comes with this product is not USB type universal charger that I was expecting from it. 3). I don't think the speaker is that great.. the sound emanating from is high on bass, I would have preferred Amazon allowing us to mix the quality preferred by me.. they should have added this feature in Alexa, since it boasts to have the world at your feet.Amazon probably would add these feature in their next generation.. but I feel cheated as I preferred to have it in the product that I brought.. not that the technology does not exists.. the sad part is that it does.. but corporation like Amazon will like milk their  customer dry",10,2

Search is not very good and most of the music is from Amazon Music Library and if you do not have Prime membership there is no point in buying this as most of the music is from Amazon music library. I got along with the free wipro wifi led light. It always has doubt when asked to switch the lights on. Good thing is the sound quality is top notch for the device that is so small and alexa can hear your command even 50 mts away in a noisy environment. That is something to cheer about, otherwise it needs a lot of improvement in its search capability.",4,3
63,Rahul Dubey,2020-10-20,Good Hardware with just okayish software,"This review is for the Echo dot (3rd gen).On the Hardware front, the device is quite good(maybe best in the market) at this price, only one thing I would want it to have is a battery inside as you have to connect it to a power source always, which makes it less portable and for scenarios when there is an electricity cut (well we live in India-a developing country, here many areas even in the top cities don't have 24 hrs of electricity, Amazon would have considered this)The software front is just average.If you have used google assistant(Ok Google) on mobile/any device then you can think as Alexa answers just around 50% efficiently compared to google assistant (according to me). Alexa doesn't understand follow-ups like google assistant, every time you have to say ""Alexa"" first for everything, and it also doesn't understand many basic questions (like what are the flights from Jaipur to Delhi?, who played most IPL matches?-->it just says I don't know the answer), you have to be more specific in framing your query for Alexa, it is also not as good as google assistant with the Hindi language. Google Assistant is much more friendly than Alexa, with all that said I would say Alexa is about Half as smart as Google assistant.Only one thing good on the software front is it has the biggest Skills' library so you can automate/routine many things.On the last note, I would say this device is good to control smart devices in your home(like smart bulbs, plugs, appliances, etc), doing routine stuff like reordering regular things on Amazon(like grocery, etc), reorder foods, book cabs, etc. and obviously to listen to music online.I never own any google smart speaker, but with my research, I think Echo dot(3rd gen) is better on the hardware front and google nest mini(2nd gen) is better on the software front, well, it depends on you which to choose.",3,3
64,Raj Narayanan,2019-04-04,Im satisfied and happy with my dot.,"I will first give the steps to connect succesfully; for a brief general performance review, you may scroll down please.To successfully pair your phone, wifi and echo:1. Plug your echo on and download alexa on your phone.2. From the alexa app, pair your phone with your echo device first to establish the first connection between your phone and your echo.3. We need to set up wifi access on echo so that alexa on echo can be alive. To do that, after you've paired your echo with your phone, proceed to where you can search for the available wifi networks. Connect to your wifi network on alexa app by entering your wifi password. Post this, your echo should be connected to wifi and alexa on your echo should be online.4. You can pair alexa with any bluetooth speakers if you have any. You may also pair your phone with your echo with bluetooth so that you may play your local AV via your echo. Yes you can play music from phone. To connect to bluetooth, enable pairing on your echo. To do that, command, 'Alexa pair' and you should hear alexa respond. When she does that, she is ready to pair; open your phone's bluetooth settings and connect to your echo. The connection should now be successful.5. Develop skills for alexa and keep interracting with her so that your relationship blooms. Any relationships are funny to understand at the beggining. Believe me, there is a deep meaning and truth in my previous sentence.As for the performance part, there's no compromise from my point of view and your echo dot can easily compete with most advanced dedicated speakers of its size.The bass is pretty decent. The treble is at a good feel as well. At full volume, there is no screeching or dampening. The sound is premium than previous echo dot.Echo plus will obviosuly nail it, way better than dot, so please do not compare plus with dot. Both peform exceptionally based on budget.You cannot wire in audio to your echo dot (nevertheless, you can bluetooth in your audio), but you can wire out to external speakers. When wiring to your external speakers maintain 15cms for optimal performance.I hope this helps. Peace'o & cheerios folks :)",7,5
65,Jithender Vanga,2018-10-22,Very informative. works great ...,"Great Device, I'm still learning what Dot can do.

I think there is a lot of improvement needed ..Need prime membership to play good songs, all songs are not available.... unable to play YouTube...best part of Alexa is that she can set multiple alarms and reminders. You can ask her any random questions, calculations, general knowledge etc. Hope Amazon will be enabling Alexa with more skills...",7,3
66,Kamal,2020-01-16,Waste of money,"- The Alexa app is useless when it comes to some configuration changes.- It does not change the WiFi connection. Tried with 2 different phones Android and IOS, but could not change the WiFi connection.- The choice of music service is very limited. Just Gaana, Saavn and Amazon Music is available. You cannot configure, change, remove or add other music services. And for some reason the device only uses Gaana and Saavn and never uses Amazon Music.- The Bluetooth is of Out mode. Means you can play music from Alexa on other devices. But you cannot play music from your phone via Bluetooth on Alexa.- Like the Bluetooth, the 3.5 mm audio jack is also of Out mode. Means you can play music from Alexa on other devices with AUX cable. But you cannot play music from your phone or small mp3 players via AUX cable on Alexa.- The Alexa voice command is definitely Not that effective or responsive as it is claimed or advertised.- It cannot help kids in pronunciation of words. If they spell the word to the device and ask for its pronunciation; the device is confused.- Sound quality is good. But not worth the money.- Ohh Great! now while I compiled my review, Amazon reduced the price by 500 to Rs. 2999 from earlier Rs. 3499. Now this is really Pathetic.",5,1

69,Jimish Bathia ,2018-10-30,Don't Forget To Remove Plastic Strips Covering The Mic!,New edited review:The issue mentioned below was again seen in new device and then i figured out i had not removed the plastic strips that covered the mic! Amazon should put a note asking users to remove it before use! This was obstructing my commands. All ok now.Old Review:It took a lot if issues while setting up with app. Luckily am tech savvy so figured out.. also - It doesnt register any commands while giving an output. So if i ask it to play a song it will but when its playing a song i ask to stop or go to next it doesn't register the command and i have to manually hit the action button to give a command. Have ordered a replacement. Fingers crossed for the next piece,7,4
70,Mikunj Rathwa,2020-08-08,Great purchase. Full value for money.,"I was pretty confused between google home mini and this one.  So decided to give it a try first.I planned to return it back once I feel like I am not that impress. But guess what, once I had hands-on, I felt like I am never gonna find any con here. I just configured everything and started using it right there.Topmost and most imp - Music quality is highly impressive. I am already done with those excessive bassy audio equipment that I have in my home - Sony 5.1 Home theatre and a jbl charge 2+.Bass is cool but its not so cool when it comes to playing music all day long.  And this echo dot fulfilled the purpose. Bass is pretty decent and mids and highs are quite crisp. It clearly sounds like some expensive device.  Besides, it plays by itself. so your phone doesnt stay occupied.It is smart enough in thousands of skills that now I dont have a second thought of returning it.I purchased wipro bulb combo at 2300.One of the best feature here is broadcasting.  I dont like making phone calls once I am outside. Alexa app allows me to type a broadcast message and send it to my home just with few clicks.Futuere is here guys.  Give it a try.  All good so far.",3,5
71,Vinoth Shankar,2019-07-21,Totally waste only sound and build quality is nice......,"Don't buy it.....!!!!!!!!!!!!!Product build quality was nice but the compared Google mini software was not to the mark ,details answering was irrelevant to the question...music support was generally with Amazon music playlist not overall but in Google mini as it was Google product search overall....not satisfied with response and answers....only alarm,time weather it's ok but most of the things were not good on software side....even app gets crashed frequently...I purchased syska smart bulb in prime day as combo....but it is connecting with echo dot...as per the setup process smart skills has to be selected but syska smart skills was not available in echo dot smart skills....then what purpose u d selling combo.......",4,1

As a user right now am feeling that it's is nothing more than a speaker.... Why???1. it's very difficult to connect with your phone.2. Need always internet.3. It can use for setting alarms but no inbuilt battery so you always need to connect with power point.4. Don't have usb port.5. Till now am not able to play music from my device memory because it's not paired with Bluetooth bz it's not user-friendly finally I have contact customer care for the same, issue yet to solve but getting proper response from them.This comment is made by my experience so please go through others experience also...",6,1
73,Ujjval Gadkari,2019-06-19,Echo Dot (3rd Gen) - Smart speaker with Alexa (White) : Echo Dot is awesome,"Well I bought Alexa on 19th May and writing this review on 19 th June.. so far my experience with Alexa is as below .All-new Echo Dot (3rd Gen) - Smart speaker with Alexa (White) : Echo Dot is awesome, it is batter then Google Home in terms of connecting your Smart TV. It is even batter in understanding your requirement. Pros and Cons as per my 30 days usage along with Google Home is as below.Pros.1) Looks very decent2) Buttons are on TOP so you will not press any button mistakenly while moving your eco dot.3) Lights are on side and in all direction, so it is easy to view that Eco dot is taking your command.4) As per my observation, Speaker and Mike are not the same, as It takes your command from quite a distance even though speaker volume is set to 3 or 4.5) You can give command from almost 10 feet with your normal voice, you need not to shout or need not to raise your voice to give command6) Connect Smart TV very easily ( I have connected my SONY Bravia 55'' X8200 E Smart TV )7) You can change volume and change Channels by simply saying channel number or name "" Alexa change channel to Star Movies HD "" or "" Alexa Next channel"" or Alexa change channel to 251"" and ""Alexa increase / Decrease volume to 50% on my TV"" ""Alexa Switch on my TV"", "" Alexa Switch off my TV""8) Sound quality is very good.9) You can connect external home theater speakers with it with help of RCA adapter cable.10) Can pronounce your name in Indian Accent11) It has a very good collection of songs, so you can enjoy the songs as per your mood and day night situations.12) It was not understanding hindi before but now Alexa can understand little hindi too.13) Last but not least, It gives detailed answer for your questions or queries or it can tell even your horoscope or your favorite recipe, It can play radio FM, distance, book cab, book Food, add things to your Amazon cart and many more.. and More...Cons.1) It has a room of improvement2) Still baby and learning many things, so don't expect answer for all your questions3) Still can do very limited after connected to Smart TV, it can not open Applications like you tube or Sony liv, Hotstar, Zee5. So you have to depend on your TV remote for this.4) The biggest limitation is, It has to be connected to power plug and socket, you can not take it in your CAR ( You can take Google home in your car or you can connect Google home anywhere as Google home has power connector same as Mobile phones)5) It can not understand many Indian words, like I tried "" Alexa Riston me darar aai by Jagjit singh ) it never understood it while Google home can even understand one word like "" Hey Google riston me darar aai""6) You still can not call on mobile, can't send SMS.",3,5
74,Indrani Das,2021-08-01,Value for money smart speaker,"I was quite confused between echo dot 3rd & 4th Gen so bought both to try and after testing, I choose 3rd Gen bcoz of following reasons.1. Very responsive to voice command in comparison to 4th Gen.2. Only 1-1.5 scale down from 4th Gen in sound and bass quality.3. I prefer 3rd Gen hockey puck design than 4th Gen round shape (personal preference).4. For higher audio quality and output one can always use external speakers via aux cable.5. Can integrate with Google even via bluetooth.6. Easy to place anywhere without any scope of rolling off.7. LED ring light looks distinctive on top than bottom (4th Gen) bcoz one can't see its 360° view.8. Plays soft music prity well than hard.9. Can fit into confined space.10. Also paid only ₹1999.What more one can ask for.",1,5
75,Aswini Sahoo,2020-03-20,Alexa is great but device needs to be improved,"I like Alexa and the features. But rated 3 due to the below facts.- No inbuilt battery. A big minus. In today's mobile world, you cannot enforce the device to be plugged in always.- No USB charging facility- Alexa app is horribly slow- The moment your wifi connection changes, it cannot detect. You need to reconfigure itPlus features- Device shape is great- Sound quality is superb- Voice response is awesome",3,3
76,nalin c.,2021-07-27,Discounted price with Add-on Item lower than the purchase price of item 18 days back,"This is unfair. You make people buy at higher prices and then bring in a special price for two days wherein you discount it heavily with an add on product for free. I paid 2800 Approx for just the Echo Dot, after waiting for a discounted price like the one in January wherein I received Echodot with Oakter. Now ofcourse at 2299/- you are offering echodot with light bulb, which beats both the purchases made by me.I think I deserve a wipro bulb for being a faithful customer..",3,5
77,Amazon Customer,2019-05-06,Not of much use - Amazon should pay the users rather than charging from them.,"The feature of Alexa Calling works only with contacts who have the echo devices. In short, you cannot use to call the mobile or phone of your contact list if the other person doesn't own another echo device. This is too absurd and a feature which should be clarified to customers in marketing communication.The voice recognition and song lists is another area which needs a lot of improvement. Until and unless the song is shared exactly as it is listed with starting words, Alexa doesn't identify it. Also, it does not play My lists in Amazon music. It is a challenge to keep repeating the command with numerous voice modulations and starting point so that Alexa plays the right song. It is a real pain.In short, in my opinion, Amazon should pay the early users for giving it a learning experience rather than charge money for such half baked product. Amazon is actually using the early users to improve Voice recognition technology and reporting the glitches of the product...",4,2
78,Pankaj Bharti,2020-07-21,Made In China,"Overall product is very good. I really loved it.But, I returned this product because it's ""Made in China"".I proud to be Indian and I respect my country and our soldiers.If Amazon can give me choice to buy same product made in different country, then I will surely buy it again.",6,4
79,Nitesh Mestry,2021-01-13,Not worth buying,"I feel like I should have bought Google device in stead of this one. Alexa simply fails to recognize hindi and Marathi songs when asked to play. Now after one year plus later I realized that I use it only for switching the lights on and off. Other than that it as usual fails to recognize the commands. You cannot play songs from YouTube. Overall I feel like I shouldn't have bought this. I spoke with couple of my friends and they also faced similar challenges.Update on Feb 16th 2021 : After posting my review I got a call from Amazon and the executive asked to test the device while he was there on the call. As expected it failed to play the songs. Then executive told me that it seems you've got wrong device, it is meant to cater to US region and soon we'll replace your device with the one meant for India region. I was assured that they'll replace my device but no time-line given. I could see the order in my Amazon order list but today, after almost a month the order was cancelled! So it's a big no from my side if you are planning to buy alexa device!",1,1
80,Karan,2021-06-29,Buy the 4th generation,"Like:1. The product is good for listening to random music playing in you room2. It is shape, size and look are appealingDislike:1. Sound quality is poor, more often than not you find the sound quality muffled.2. Volume sometimes feels weak, it should have been a bit higher3. It can used as a Bluetooth speaker for random song playing from your phone but you can’t use it to listen to audio content like watching an audio clip / series / Netflix etc. in such a scenario the audio is muffled and difficult to comprehend.4. It’s plays music from Amazon music which lacks variety in its music. We’ll also know it’s nothing like YouTube library5. Finally, when Alexa doesn’t even understand or comprehend your request, it gets annoying to the next level.6. Volume is audible in limited space… you’re room for example.Conclusion: it’s a device good for listening to random music in your room playing constantly in the background while you’re at your chores.I got it coz I didn’t have a secondary phone to play music on my Bluetooth speaker.",1,2
81,Aman,2020-10-23,Very Disappointed with it's Voice Recognition,"I seriously hate saying ""Alexa"" now. Voice recognition is the worst thing I have experienced in this device. I just use this in a small 10x10 room and most of the time I have to repeatedly repeat and repeat or even yell ""Alexa"" to wale the device.I never expected to get such experience from this device after going through ratings and reviews of the device. I was confused between Google Nest Mini and Alexa Echo Dot 3rd Generation and only choose this because of AUX output which was really useful feature but just after few hours since I am using this, I am really frustrated with it. I have tried resetting the device and voice training it but nothing helped. It is placed just 2 feet away on bedside table and no noise but it still won't get the word ""Alexa"" or understand most of the time. I have to always repeat myself and speak louder. Far field microphone feature on the device description says it can hear you from across the room. Seriously!!? It cannot even catch the ""Alexa"" word from 2-3 feet away and if its playing music even on low volume then it won't work at all and I have to yell ""Alexa"" many times from a feet or even closed to make it stop.Even it's Alexa assistance doesn't get me most of the time and just goes dormant without any response.Very disappointed with it. Going to return it now.",2,2
82,Sandip Kumar De,2018-10-16,Toy for the big boy,What an amazing product? A must have for all home. Spend some more money in the smart home accessories and you can use its full power.

I use my BOSE speaker system quite seamlessly.,7,5

86,Binu Raman,2019-11-08,"Alexa is so stupid, which you’ll realise once you buy it","Alexa is so stupid, which you’ll realise once you buy it. There are other brand devices that are more intelligent and more useful. For a silly example, you can’t say “Alexa, switch on Bedroom light” at once. Instead, you have to first say “Alexa”, and wait until it responds, and then tell what you want Alexa to do as a separate command. Another example, if you have 2 lights named as “Hall light 1” and “Hall light 2”, and you ask Alexa to switch on “Hall light 1”, most probably Alexa will ask you back “There are multiple devices named Hall light. Which one do you want to switch on?”. That means while talking to Alexa, you’re not allowed to change your mood or tone until the command is complete. Theirs example, if you happen to start asking slowly to Alexa, “Alexa, I want to ask you about...”, immediate Alexa will reply you “Here is what I found on the web about ‘I want to ask you about’”, without even allowing you to complete your question.",3,1
87,Kapil Soni,2020-12-26,Could have been better,"We purchased Gen3.  The voice of assistance is too heavy. No equalizer settings.  App has a very poor design and functionality.  Sound of music is rich, but very poor in high frequency (treble), bass is good as per the size of speaker.  Overall, good to hear music.  AI is just okay, has very limited AI features, Mobile's Google voice is way more intelligent in answering questions.  Good for wakeup alarms and listening music.  Apps like spotify is very poor as opposed to Advertisement shown.  Youtube selects better song lists rather than Amazon's music or Spotify.  Gaana is still better, but way behind Youtube.  Crux: If you have a small and good quality speaker system, just pair with your mobile and it shall be better; more better if use an old phone as no sms & phones shall disturb.  These smart speakers are always listening (except for mute) ... always leaves me in doubt.",1,4
88,Chakraborty,2020-07-06,Total value for money...,"In a word... Just fabulous...Not that much works in queries like Google. But GK level is quite good.For music it's outstanding.Voice recognition, sound quality, the LED ring ... All experiences are just awesome.Don't know about Home assistance, didn't try but didn't work to call or message on any number. Whom you are calling need to be added with your Alexa Profile. Of course you won't give access to outsiders. It's only use for family members only. So it's not useful that much.But After all these ifs & buts... Me & my family members like it very much..",2,5
89,anil kumar,2019-05-22,Not compatible with most wifi networks,"first of all the alexa  app itself is around 79MB, the app response is dead slow. i got frustrated by the time it took to move from one screen to next screen. above all echo dot 3rd gene doesn't connect any of my wifi networks throwing the error"" registration failed try again later"" while my amzon fire stick works perfectly with all net works. i am very disappointed with the device , actually so excited to use this as i am a die hard fan of amazon but now i had return it.",4,1
90,Shiva Kakkar,2019-06-19,Good for cheap home automation,"I read a number of reviews where people trying to connect it to their phone hotspot are not able to. The solution is to in reading the instructions carefully. If you want to connect to a hotspot don't select the phones WiFi network during setup on alexa app. There is a separate option at the bottom (where the wifi networks are listed) to connect to the phone hotspot. Next, in the hotspot settings of your phone check that you have allowed unknown devices to connect. For example, in Samsung phones by default it allows only known devices to be connect to the the hotspot. Turn off the setting and Echo will connect to the phones hotspot. I have two wifi networks configured for my echo. If my first network goes down, Echo switches to my phone hotspot easily. Just read the setup instructions carefully.I bought it for automation and multiroom music streaming. It fulfills the purpose to a large extent. However, I feel that Amazon should have given more granular control of volume. The 10 level volume doesn't give you much control and sometimes going from (say) level 7 to level 8 is too much of a jump. Secondly, the volume of alexa and the connected speaker doesn't sync. Each has to be adjusted independently. In Samsung phones you have the option to bind the phone volume and speaker volume. This sort of function should be there. Apart from this, the third party development and support for the connectedness devices is excellent and I feel it'll trump Google home in some time. That ways I can see it as a much more future proof bet.",3,4
91,Dhruv.S,2019-03-22,Can get better in the future,"So I wanted a device to control my smart home devices via my voice so I bought the echo do, I got a really good deal as I paid just 3.6k for it (The actual retail price is 4.5k).So i v already owned an Alexa for a while .And there are a lot of things that it can do but it also lacks in some places .Pro's:1. Works great with automation and wifi devices (switches , light etc).2.pretty loud for the sound .3.mic's are great can pic the sound really well.4.robust design .5.can perform tasks related to amazon and some other apps like zomato , ola , ndtv , aajtak , saavan and a few more .Cons:1. Cannot play music from spotify , although Spotify is now in india the echo dot doesn't support it in India it ll say that Spotify is not available in your region.2.cannot do Google related tasks , for example if I ask it for the ""price of Hayabusa"" it search's for Hayabusa on amazon and tell me the price of random toys , has issue with SEARCHING for stuff.3. Lacks a lot of voice features and has some glithes like when u tell it to start stopwatch it asks me for alarm .4. Heats up a bit on the top .5.wifi coverage isn't the best .Well If you are looking for good sound and not so many voice features then echo dot is for you , but if u want to person searches and play music on Spotify then I feel google home is a better option.Alexa can get better in the future but for now it lacks quite a lot of features",4,4
92,Arun Suresh,2019-05-07,Nice compact intelligent ai assistant with a Bluetooth speaker.,"Overall good product. With double offer it was reasonably priced. Good voice recognition. The sound and it's quality could have been slightly better. However I feel only people with Amazon prime will benefit from the Amazon music. Otherwise I'm not aware of any other way of listening to music as of now. Pandora is not available in India. It may play from web? Not sure of that.There is an option on asking for a radio station where it tunes and plays songs from it. Did not try and the video was American. Voice recognition is spot on. With Amazon prime there is option to shop online through alexa, good list of songs such that u can say a song name or artist and Alexa will play. Intelligent enough ai that I felt like iron Man talking to Jarvis.",3,4
93,Subahsish Adhikary,2018-11-12,Alexa Echo Dot is one of the must buy smart home gadgets,"I'm a tech-savvy guy, I own both Google Home Mini & Echo Dot 3rd gen.Bought this on Great Indian sale for just 2999/- only.Reviewing it after 2 weeks of using it.Okay, my first thought was how much Alexa is suitable for the Indian Audience. Ans? Totally worth it.Setting up Alexa using the Alexa app is critical not that tough if you know what features/skills you want to use on Alexa.Alexa can recognize Indian accent very much like Google Assistant. Shocked? You better be, that the beauty.The sound? More than enough. It beats its rival Google Home mini in this aspect.Do you need to have a Prime subscription?This again depends on your need, currently, I'm using Alexa & FireTV without any prime subscription. Just change the streaming services to saavn if the music is your 1st priority.Alexa is much more like Family device it responds to everyone's voice. That's a disadvantage too.I found it better in many aspects than google home mini.Alexa can read ebooks from your Kindle account, audiobooks from audible. That pretty impressive.There are a lot other cool things that Alexa can do which I can't cover here.Alexa Echo Dot Advantages:Play music loud.Can respond to your queries very well.Somewhat close to Google Home mini in terms of being a virtual assistant.Create to-do lists(not available on Google Assistance).Shop from Amazon Pantry.Disadvantages:Not as good as google assistance in doing continued conversation.It does not support gaana appAlexa responds to everyone even strangers, unlike Google Home which is limited users.Alexa is one of the must buy smart home gadgets that one should get.",4,5
94,Anirban Das,2019-11-12,Superb Buy,"One of my best purchases so far from Amazon . I purchased this product after going through a lot of reviews and researches . At one point is was almost convinced to buy the Google Home mini ,but eventual decided to buy the Amazon Echo dot 3rd Gen , after finding out that it has modified itself to understand Indian ascent. So here are the pros and cons after 1 month of usagePROS-Smooth InstallationGet the Alexa app at your cell phone and installation is smooth and easyConnecting to the wifi is ok - at first it took a while , but then it was smoothConnecting to a blue tooth device is really fastLovely sound quality and is decent enough for a big sized room.Can play almost any song (i tried , hindi , eng and of course being a Bong i tried all sorts of Bengali songs)Yes it plays maximum songs from Amazon Music , and then goes to Sawan or other music libraries too.Language can be set as English and HindiOne can set reminders , play quiz, it can make animal sounds , ask about weather conditions and forecast , in fact it can answer most of your queries .(its a best fried of my 1 year old son)If you have a smart light , you can even set to turn on/off the light (in my case i got the Wipro smart led bundled as free)CONSHave to admit that the search option has to be updated a little , in case of  little difficult things it cant search its library and ansCant play songs from YouTube (obviously copyright issue )Its always plug and play , it doesn't have a battery . Makes it a little difficult to carry , cos it requires electric plug-ins (unlike portable Bluetooth speakers )over all its a great buy , barring few negative things which obviously can be ignoredand what makes it more amazing is that i got it at 40% discount during the GREAT INDIAN FESTIVAL",2,5
95,Prasad Shrivatsa,2020-07-21,Not for all. Suits teens best.,"Echo Dot is a good speaker and voice recognition is quite impressive. However, Alexa integration is still in the development phase. So be prepared to get frustrated.If you are someone who loves the old classics, you will find Alexa very disappointing. And don't forget, you need Amazon Music's premium account to be able to stream music on Echo Dot. That also means, Akexa will play only that music which is available on Amazon Music. I'm not a big fan of Amazon Music. It does not have much of my kind of music.Alexa also plays from Jio Savn and Hungama. So getting Alexa to play some music is not always a simple task to perform. And a lot of times, you want Alexa to play an album you saw on Amazon Music or Hungama but the voice assistant fails to find it!I don't have complaints about operating smart appliances with Alexa though. It's totally fun.Edit-1: It has been five months since I started using Echo Dot and I still can't easily find the music I love. On this Independence Day I tried to get Alexa play some classic patriotic songs like ""Jahaan Daal Par Sone Ki..."" but no matter what words I used, Alexa kept playing a playlist called ""Ai Watan"" which seemed to have all new songs, none of which I liked. Clearly, the music that Alexa offers has been selected by Amazon keeping in mind today's teens. And this won't change.",1,2

97,Bhan Satya,2019-03-06,Good hardware marred by limited feature set for Indian customers,"Upgraded from 2nd to 3rd Gen dot, must say the sound quality has improved phenomenally. While the previous gen dot was more of an ""Echo Input"" type functionality, this one can actually serve as a decent speaker. Coming to the software side:1. Apple music not supported in India. In fact the only available services are Amazon music, Saavn and Hungama music2. Amazon music has a very limited catalog  and Indian users can't upload their songs either ( apparently US users can do this)3. Spotify not available ""yet""4. Youtube/ Google play music not supported for obvious reasons5. Because of the above I tried to give Saavn a shot as their catalog is surprisingly large, but then Alexa doesn't support playlists for Saavn.Summary:If you are planning to get an Echo for listening music - stay away from this (or any Echo device for that matter) - at least for now.",3,4

Alexa is everywhere where has internet.i m really amazed was going to buy Google mini but compare to this luxurious Google mini no match for look or sound. And Alexa is getting better everyday but not match for Google. Who wanna reminders alerts, songs, sound quality and looks go for this. Google take voice commands better. But Alexa also does everything I need 100%.",3,5
100,SnoopyDa,2019-08-19,Inferior to the 2nd Gen and Echo Dot,"The speaker can't be used as a wireless Bluetooth speaker.It's AUX interface is an audio in only. So unlike the 2nd gen echo or the echo dot, you can neither transfer the audio to a secondary better speaker nor to any headphone or earphone.It does not have a battery so it always needs to be powered.The above are serious shortcomings not anticipated from a newer generation device.Apart from that, the Alexa integration works pretty well and as expected. However Alexa seems far inferior to Apple Siri when it comes to maintaining the context of a conversation.Overall a nice buy if you wish to experience a voice enabled product that can get a lot of things done. But perhaps not worth the price given the above observed shortcomings.If any of my observations are inaccurate, please do leave a comment. The views are personal and with no intent to promote or prevent any buying decisions.",2,2

102,Nishant,2019-01-09,A mediocre overpriced product.,"I have been using the Alexa for about a month now. Following are the reasons for buying or not buying it:Why buy Alexa?-New tech, voice assistant feels you powerful.-Good acoustics. You can hear the songs from anywhere around your home.-Good for engineering purpose. You may hack it for your own bespoke purpose, for IOT applications.-Amazing new tech.Why I don't recommend buying Alexa?-It works wobbly when it comes to giving voice commands in between an ongoing music or action.-Does not work with Google Maps.-Serch engine is poor and limited too.-More expensive than it's counterpart, Google Home Mini.",5,3

This is very useful as analog FM reception in our area is very bad. Through skills it reminds me of my medication.  Command detection is mostly accurate. But when searching for music, it plays wrong songs at times may be because of the very limited music collection with amazon. Pairing with a second Bluetooth speaker using ""discover"" command is not working unless you remove the already paired device using Alexa app. I wish the alarms and reminders had user programmable/uploadable bells/voices as there is only one sound in the alarm settings.",1,5

It fails terribly due to lack of  thinking by the designers.1. This devise should require  a password or PIN or recognize the voice of the person before proceeding further.  It should not allow anyone to hijack your device- in my case my 7 year old, who keeps fiddling with the reminders  or moving it away from a central location to his room. ( don't tell me you can't do voice classification, then at least ask a PIN ). For me the device is useless now, as I may not even hear it and important reminders may get removed. 2. The India model at least has no working profanity filter, my son plans music with profanity and there is no way to restrict access.3. Searches sometimes fail miserably- it is not recognition, the problem is the content that is being searched for an answer.  Google's device is probably is stronger here with search results4. The reminders should  have an option to repeat till I turn it off by saying ""acknowledged' or 'done'",0,2

While the speakers sound good, the speakers on my phone sound better (without the headphones).Besides I feel most of these voice regognition devices make you a lazy person & a couch potato..so get up exercise switch on & off the lights yourself, walk move & do your own errands..Meanwhile wait for a better Amazon device.",3,1

New eco dot is too far from accuracy and may lead to frustration while interacting with the device.It cannot recognise the books available on kindle library which is a very basic skill. It cannot recognise songs we request. Cannot play popular songs as well. Not sure what kind of advanced tasks it can perform when fail to do very basic tasks. Great disappointment.,6,2

It struggles to play my music from my phone without lagging or getting disconnected from amazon music. There aren't enough services in this region either.Literally the only thing you'll ever use this for is to play music, nothing else. But saying ""Alexa, next"" every time is exhausting if you have a large music library. And because connectivity to the phone app is terrible, it's a pain to even to do something as simple as changing the music.Google assistant is a hundred times better. I'm serious, this product serves no purpose. Just buy a normal speaker instead, it'll at least have better connectivity than this worthless piece of plastic.",0,1
117,R44,2021-04-28,"Decent product, but has many software bugs... Hope they are fixed in the future.","Hello,I purchased this from somewhere else.. After using it for a while, i noticed the amazon music service doesn't work at all. I was under the impression that amazon music, which is freely available with echo devices would work. After trying for hours to make it work i gave up, Alexa replied that ""She couldn't find anything"" whenever i tried to play something on amazon music. The only service that works good so far is Hungama Music. I am saying this after testing all the other services like Gaana, JioSaavn, Spotify etc... Gaana works as well but it has some issues... Spotify also works but lacks many songs.Aside from that, the mics are good but only till the volume medium, because high volume makes the device hard to hear us. Anything over volume level 6 is bad, and Alexa won't hear us unless we shout at her. I really liked the 2nd gen which had 7 mics yet this one only offers 4.. which is a downside for me. Hardware wise the sound quality is good until the volume level 8, but anything over that makes the sound distort and would be a pain to hear it.Alexa is on the other hand is good to talk to, she (It) can play music, tell jokes, read stories, sing songs, set alarms, set reminders, control smart devices etc... with the bonus of human like speech. This was the factor made me buy this. But on the downside she lacks too much intelligence compared to her counter part Google assistant.. She can't even answer the basic questions and just forwards us to Wikipedia. I hope amazon continues to improve Alexa.So as a new buyer which one to buy? Alexa or GoogleIf you don't care about how the assistant speaks, (robotic speech vs human like speech) then go for Google assistant speaker. Because Google and Alexa devices can both can do the job for smart homes. But Google uses their vast database infrastructure for information so obviously it will have upper hand in this department.But if you care about how your speaker speaks then go for Alexa.. without thinking anything.If you care about information then go for Google assistant else Alexa should be your preference.",1,4

Just coz they are manufacturing these, they cannot do such a huge injustice to their buyers by dropping price to half......This is a very bad trend and definitely bad service by amazon.

I even tried signing out of the Alexa app on my phone and then tried logging into her account on my phone and as soon as I would log in, the app would go blank.I'm still confident that there is nothing wrong with the Echo device but there is a problem in the Alexa app. More specifically there is a problem with my mother's account on the Alexa app. Unfortunately there is no way to fix this or talk to any kind of customer support. Customer support is a chat bot which has a preset list of questions that you need to select. There is no way to get any support for the app.My suggestion would be to stay away from such 'dumb' smart speakers. Amazon US is very helpful, because the laws in  that country require them to be. Amazon in India sucks when it comes to Alexa app support, because there is no way to talk/ chat to someone who can check the account.Its strange that my worst purchase from Amazon is actually an Amazon product and not something sold by a listed seller.",0,1

It worked fine. But overall Alexa was disappointing. Even after having 4 mics the voice recognition was only a tad better than Google. The sound is natural but artificially natural, a little muffled as well.The app is poor. What takes less than a minute to setup on Google Home it takes over 3-4 minutes on alexa app. I have over 40 smart devices in my home and the time it needed merely setting up those devices was a bummer. Echo or Alexa is is just popular because Amazon sells it while Google devices are not marketed that much.",0,2

Bit to be honest, its not that good in hearing your voice as 2nd gen do. I am having trouble making it listening.-  led circle light is little dull. I dont like it.- no great in sound except a 10% increase in bas. Say prev. Gen was having zero bass n its having little bass.- more asthetic look. I liked it.- power cable is not usb micro so u cant connect to other power sources. Its having adapter. So u re more on home stuck like to power socket. I am usong 2nd gen in car as well with usb cable.- bulkier, maybe good for sound n more of in stuff but earlier was more smaller n compact having ligher weight.CONCLUSIVE: Its addition of money and new device.

In the device settings they changed it from Amazon.com to Amazon.in, and asked me to restart the device..basically turn it off and on. I did and and just had to say Alexa play this song from Gaana and it started playing. The gadget has good voice recognition. Though sometimes when the music volume is high it may not do so.

There are many skills which can be enabled and the reviews in the skills can help you to understand if the skills actually work or not the way you expect it too. Hope this review helps you.",4,5
126,C.L. Verma,2020-09-28,size to sound ratio is just excellent,"The size to sound ratio is just excellent, the emphasis seems to be on voice but the base is absent so this is not for the base head.This is the most responsive voice integration that I have seen, as you say, Alexa, it starts listing. There are a lot of things that you can ask Alexa like adding a product in your Amazon cart, open rain sound, play music, set alarm, etc.The interesting thing is that Alexa also listing commands in Hindi as well. This is only a part of the home automation system. All the smart equipment/products you purchase can be connected with Alexa like a light bulb to control it with voice etc. but for that, you need a router in your home.ConclusionThe speaker does not have a battery but he can be connected via Bluetooth from your phone and PC. Which is a good thing but all of a sudden it stops playing for no reason which is very annoying?I got it in INR 2500, at this price you must buy it, just to experience a smart speaker but in INR 3500 it looks a bit expansive.

This has communication features so people having alexa app or echo device and permission can actually call you on your echo dot.2. This has announcement features so if you are late for dinner you can announce that on your echo device from your phone.(Actually i use this feature to play ghost sounds when little kids are in my room😝)3.

But, their internet connectivity and strength are questionable. Therefore, the right review can not be given. However, for music play, it is really attractive and interesting. However, Alexa has to learn a lot before getting five stars. Secondly, Alexa understands English. There are many other features which are not understood by a general user. Thirdly, in order to make a smart home and make Alexa a hub of such a home requires a lot of money. Those features can only be placed under the review when they are arranged.However, even then, I will recommend to buy it.

Negative part of this Echo dot 3rd is it has circular plugin port to echo dot which should be usb 2.0 which 2nd Gen echo dot have plus point here. I think Amazon should change this Power Plugin port to normal USB 2.0 so that we can connect our Smartphone charger cables to it and connect it to any Power bank.

Its total worth it, Amazing Value for Money.",1,5
142,Shreya,2020-09-19,Helpful and Smart,"I got this as a gift and it reminds me of everything, connects to my meditation app and also plays loud music. You can also have a fun discussion, play games, etc. The wipro bulb which comes along with it is a boon too as I don't have to reach for the switch anymore, when I'm too sleepy. It's great. I guess Alexa is learning and getting better because she still can't understand some questions, but other than that it's all great",1,5

Not able to set customized tone for alarm and lots of other drawbacks.To Sum it all, it's waste of 3500 valuable bucks as there's no easy way to throw it off.",1,2

It has live my Bose speaker system which was getting dust due to either connect to aux cable with mobile or connect to traditional way.3. My kids loved this and started talking to Alexa in tooti footi English language, but after some time they started framing the sentence before talking to Alexa, cool thing.4. Some of the features are very good like songs, news, shopping list, todo list and reminders etc. hope to continue getting more features into it.",2,5
146,ashok,2020-10-27,unique product,Product is good but if a perforated box had been given then it would have been good so that we could have ensured that there is no dust entry and when we operate it because of perforations sound should not be a problem and also the box should have a provision to insert the plug.In this way we could have kept in a place where there is no dust entryMay be for futureregards,1,5

My return window is already closed.Secondly, song searching on Gaana app is very poor. I am very fond of Riya's Retro, but Alexa can search only season 1 and moreover it doesn't recognize different episodes of season 1 either. Means if you have already gone through 4-5 episodes of Riya's Retro and want to listen to the next episode, you have to start from episode 1 and then have to skip the episode you have already gone through. It takes hell lot of time to play the next episode after you give the voice command ""Next"".AMAZON SHOULD REPLACE MY ECHO DOT.",0,2

152,aseem,2020-07-16,Fun device. Good music volume. Yet mechanical,"1. Size is small, Looks good in home, material is good2. It can fill your entire room with good volume of music. Volume vs size of device is really good.3. Alexa sound is mechanical, we're still 3-4 years earlier for a natural sound of robot in such devices.4. Can't expect latest GK questions / smart / complicated 2 sentences combined queries, bcoz results are per google search and google can't put logics in queries yet as it's mostly keyword relevance matching. So, overall experience is still mechanical.5. Music library it connects to are Saavn and it doesn't have good music for night sleep, it keeps repeating it.6. It blindly plays what the apps give it to play, like, the mood based music search is not good. It sometimes play songs as per direct matching of lyrics with what we spoke but totally not as per intention at all. Such devices totally needs a smarter search engine which understands intention.Overall small fun device, but I still feel that such devices will take some years to mature and become truly seamless home assistants. But it's for parents and they like it enough :D",0,3
153,DILEEP M NAMBIAR,2019-05-20,Great product from Amazon.,This was the product I was looking for.Confused to buy Google home mini or Amazon echo dot finally I bought this.It has great sound quality (bass) and looks so nice due to its colourful ring.The sound of the voice assistant is great.I think a downside for this product will be a mandatory prime subscription to play songs free. Limited music recognition in regional languages.,2,5
154,Mayapur in Bengal,2019-08-13,Old Age Personal Assistant,"This review is at the end of the third week of use. I use the Echo Dot 3rd generation for answering questions, setting reminders, alarms, to-do, and shopping lists. I do not use it very often for music. At my age (over 70) and being retired, a person can be more active and busier than ever before. Often we need to remind ourselves to do things such as taking medicine, do my yoga, keep up with my art class, do my accounting, practice my harmonium or other daily tasks accomplished on a schedule. Many times older people have brief thoughts that we need to remember. Remembering that thing you wanted to buy or do from the other day, of which the memory of that usually occurs in situations such as doing the dishes or taking a shower when your hands are wet so writing it down needs to be put off. Now you can yell at Alexa.I’ve told you how I use the Echo Dot, let me tell you how I feel about this purchase. I can’t believe I waited for so long to buy one of these things. The Echo Dot is a huge help for me; it's like having an assistant. I use Alexa and the Echo Dot many times a day for all of its features, including remembering things that may have otherwise gone undone or forgotten.I speak several languages, including proper English and in the last three weeks, the only time Alexa has not understood what I have said is when I have mumbled, garbled or otherwise mispronounced something. Other than those very few times voice recognition has been perfect. The Echo Dot sits on my desk; however, today I ordered a wall holder (the type without the plug just a holder) to mount it on my bookcase right in front of my home desk. The sound coming from the Echo Dot carries far into my residence and is easily heard and understood from a reasonable distance.I downloaded the Amazon Alexa app for my Android phone. You don’t need to use this app in daily use, but you will use it during device setup and review of what you have voiced onto the Echo Dot for lists, alarms, and reminders. You can also hear those by asking Alexa. And thank goodness you don’t need the Alexa app for more than that. It’s awful. I think the word “awful” is the most used in all the reviews. Almost always your Alexa app will say that your Echo Dot is offline when it is never offline. Most of the studies agree with this. So yes, if you buy an Echo Dot, you will download and use the Alexa app, but after setup, I’ve not found any use for it other than to touch the button on my phone to see when the app works and does not work. My Echo Dot works 100% of the time, and if the internet to the house is working the Echo Dot will be working correctly and automatically.This purchase of the Echo Dot has been a big boost for me. I am happy to have moved forward technology-wise with this device. For anyone who wants more productivity in their life, this is a good buy. And now, I have something to say to Alexa before I sign off: Alexa, wake me up from my nap in 30 minutes.90 day update: See picture of the wood stand. Using daily for everything the Echo is designed to do. Voice recognition near perfect. I can have my back to the Echo from across the room and yell out a command no problem. I've added a couple of Skill Blueprints which have been excellent. I am using many reminders which have been a boon to my productivity. Had a local carpenter make a wood stand made for above my desk to hold the Echo Dot and my camera.",0,5
155,shashank,2020-11-21,Totally Amazed,"This is just awesome.There are so many things we can do with this device and that made me wonder that why this is so cheap.I got a smart bulb with the device in just 2500 rs.Now I control my bluetooth speaker, my tv(firestick) and my bedroom light with my voice commands.This is fun for my 4 years old kid too and Alexa tell stories to him.The voice recognition is very good and the proof is that even my kid's commands Alexa recognise.",1,5
156,Darayus E.,2020-09-09,The future is now!,"Simply great product. Well built and very worth it. The voice recognition is great and works as intended most of the time. It keeps getting better as you use it. The sound really surprised me for its size. It's definately not a premium sound but it's still very bassy and loud, and full volume there is noticible disturbunce. The home automation part is what really makes this worth it though. I have my lights, tv and ac connected (using oakter remote) and ofcourse it's also an alarm, an intercom, a music player, a smart assistant and so much more. Life changing tech this is. I also like that you can command it in hindi and english. The conversations to be had are funny and almost natural. Software updates can/should make it even better. Wish it also had battery back up though, that's its biggest flaw. Soon I'll connect many other electronics in my house to alexa by way of smart switches.",0,5
157,Leen Joshi,2019-05-01,Huge disappointment,"Honestly, please don't buy this product. Better to purchase a Bluetooth speaker and play the songs manually. I bought this with excitement to gift someone, but it didn't work as expected. It was my luck that I tried it first before gifting, & the experience was pathetic. Initially you will like calling Alexa, but again and again you will get bored. OK no problem, that's the feature. But main issue is it doesn't even play the latest popular songs. Huge disappointment.. I asked to play one song in front of my family, but it started some other music (that was very bad), & then I decided to return it back because I don't want to get insulted. People will laugh on you when you ask calling alexa alexa and it won't play your song.",4,1
158,jd,2019-10-10,Voice recognition/understanding not that good as it's build,"The Echo Dot 3rd Gen is comparatively good that than it's predecessor. The sound quality is improved, however there are two things that I would like to being to the notice of it's manufacturer or would say the developers rather. The bluetooth connectivity is no good. it's very difficult to connect to any other bluetooth device. Now coming to the main part of the Echo : voice recognition or rather would say it's integration. The Indian voice is a disaster. Half of the time you will have to repeat even for the simpler terms and words. Half disappointed, else it's good.",1,4
159,Pawan Lohani,2019-11-10,Make your home smart with this great choice. Highly recommended. Superb.,"Make your home smart like this smart Echo Dot. Thankyou Amazon for giving us such a great product. I am so happy with this deal.  This is really a smart and improved speaker for richer and louder sound and it fits perfectly into small spaces. Very goodVoice control for our music. But the main thing is that we should have strong Wi-Fi connection for proper functioning and one more weak point is It has Stream music from Amazon Prime Music, JioSaavn, and Gaana only. Loving points are we have to just Ask Alexa to play music, answer questions, read the news, check the weather, set alarms, control compatible smart home devices so my family even my little son loves it a lot and it Built with multiple layers of privacy protections and controls, including a microphone off button that electronically disconnects the microphones. Alexa is skill based, overall it's a great deal.  Don't think more just go for it.",0,5
160,Anmol,2020-10-24,Review after 2.5 months usage. It's a great purchase for me.,"I felt the sound quality is great at the price of 2249 during sale. The alexa integration is really good with all the amazing alexa skills available in echo dot. The voice recognition is average coz when the volume is above 5 , alexa couldn't recognize the wake word as the music is loud. So, we would require to shout to let her hear the wake word. I hope this might be resolved in the new (4th) generation as the sound will be focusing in 1 direction rather than 360 degrees, this is what i feel through looking at the design. The response time is good but can be improved in thr next generation yet to be released. Overall, this device is worth the purchase at regular price and during the sale it becomes much more worthy at the price of 2249. There are many hidden features in alexa which are not known by the majority customers like explicit filter, treble base and mid-range regulator, talk slow, talk fast, follow-up mode, sing a song, feedback, Horoscope, movie dialogues, quotes, Translation,  excellent mind and strategy games, kids games and fun games like Shadow game, Akinator, Bulls and Cows, Guess the number, Music mania, Yes Sire etc. and many more fabulous features. Please do a little search on Google about Alexa Skills and who knows you may be able to discover some great hidden features or a new feature. Also, at regular intervals, please do ask your alexa to check for software updates and update the device. It will allow you to enjoy new features with every update. Although, Alexa may not be the greatest invention but it is definitely the sweetest invention and yes it's becoming smarter everyday. Alexa is not comparable to other devices like google home, google nest, apple homepod, etc. as they have different features and different price segments. If you need a wide range of features and skills for daily use and fun, Alexa devices are the perfect choices. Believe me, even with those flaws i mentioned, Alexa will be a cheer. Just go for it.",1,5

162,Kumar,2019-11-28,Way to go.,"Well, it certainly does few things but way to go. I don't understand with all the money and talent Amazon has, why they didn't provide simple skill to under stand simple commands like Enter/Select, Go up, Go down etc. so that we can use it proper remote.Pros:1. Lots of fun. You can roast your friend by setting simple routine which can be activated by customized voice phrase and it will respond with your customized messages.2. You can control your TV, FireStick etc but in a limited way.3. Can ask for time while half asleep...it provides many other simple features and some of them are useful too.Cons:1. Doesn't recognize Select, UP, Down and other navigation command. So cannot replace you fire TV remote.2. Misses the command now and then.3. Difficult to give voice command while there are other sounds around like if you are watching TV of listening to music. That's very frustrating as you cannot pause video if sound coming from TV is high.",0,3

  Never thought how useful the echo dot could be. It really automates your home. If you can get some smart bulbs and smart plugs it can switch them on and off at your command, pair it with a smart remote of your choice and it can control your appliances like tv, set-top box and ac( those using infra red remotes). The sound is also very clear and amazon music has a vast library so it can play most songs you request. A very useful gadget if you know how to use it.",0,5

The volume is loud enough for a big room for sure.,1,4
168,J pathak,2020-08-14,Pathetic,"A great device to get started, echo dot is a great device to first know your requirement. Alexa is integrated well enough but the voice recognition will give you trouble in later stages as it fails to recognise simple regular commands after a while, you will only see the blue light which after taking no action will turn off and resume the ongoing task. Many times it will disappoint and embarrass you, can only hope it to get better in future.Update:After using it for 1 year i would say it isn't that good of a device, now out of 10 times calling itout, it wouldd hardly respond twice. May be they have made the 4th gen better in this aspect but this device if you're even getting at a discounted price of 1k, don't bother. Not worth your money.",1,1
169,Amitava Saha,2019-10-20,Not very smart,"I had very high hope for alexa. Howe it turned out to be disappointment. As speaker it sounds great, no doubt about it. Alexa is far behind from Google home. It can do basic stuff like play music, control smart devices, reminders etc. But it falls flat when you try to lookup information. That's where Google assistant excels. Most of the time alexa would simply respond with I don't know where as Google will find that information. I really wanted to like it but alexa is disappointment and I had to return it.",0,2

Only problem is with Eco dot 3rd generation device that it’s only launch an app but never plays a video, especially YouTube.. This feature is a very basic one and should be added with this device which will enhance the product services overall.. Please take it as a consideration. Also it should be connected to atleast 2 Firesticks or 2 TV’s in a single home.. This should be the minimum. I am very much sure, if these two features could be added with this device, it will enhance the overall service of the product and will reach to many other people in India and thus increase the sale of the product..",0,3
172,Ohm,2020-10-16,Okay for songs,"Pros: Sound quality is good, hardware and design makes perfect fit.. Hardware quality worth for the money. Automation works well like switching on the light and other stuffs.Cons: Software not upto the par. Apart from Amazon music, other apps like spotify, gaana are not supported upto the mark.

Since this smart device works on cloud, it is never going to be outdated but for some delayed firmware updates.However if you are looking at this from an audiophile perspective, try out the larger Amazon echo for its phenomenal sound prowess.However for me the amazon echo dot 3rd generation is a perfect mix of an excellent Smart device with a reasonable good sound which lets you differentiating the low, mids and highs of your favourite songs.

Alexa actually can play the exact song to the 100% accuracy.Sound quality is awesome with this small sized powerpack. Romantic and slow songs music are just lovable. Although if u like badhash or some hip hop music. U can use an additonal speaker and connect this to it..Mics are quite sensitive and can take orders from other room. Only at high volume u need to yell still not but a concern though.Product build quality excellent.Just an amazing product. U will sure love it.Day 10 and still exploring it.

177,S.

This device is worth every penny for the integration with amazon music and sound quality alone, and the additional integrations provide for a very rick user experience.PS: I have never used google home mini, so this is not a comparative opinion.",0,5
178,Kapil P.,2020-08-08,Satisfactory,Used this device for about a couple days now and so far I've observed it can play any  English song you ask pretty easy but when asked about a hindi song it either plays a wrong song or it can't understand. Hence asked Alexa to change her language to indian English and Hindi. Now the accent and voice is of a Indian lady and not the original US English accent but still face difficulty in getting it to play the hindi songs I request. But I guess it will learn to recognise my words slowly. Although it's a wonderful device with many uses but it needs to work on getting the right hindi songs.,1,4

It can play music (i use amazon music & spotify) with ease.

Initial impressions it works as advertised however I am not sure if the one or two times I use this on a daily basis to turn off the light it is worth the amount I paid. Is not anything else it works as a smart speaker and you can tell Alexa to play songs at the convince of your voice. It's want to talk to Alexa and laugh at funny responses. Alexa isn't as smart as you want it to be and a lot of you questions are responded with ""I don't know that"".If your locality has a lot of power outages it might be a problem specially sense Alexa takes about a couple of minutes to reconnect if it loses power. It also will not work if you don't have an active internet connection which is a  huge bummer. But overall I'm very happy with the purchase and I would recommend others to give it a try as well. I hear some people use it to learn English.",0,4
186,jainrk4u,2020-05-31,Wonderful experience,"I had heard about Alexa from friends, but it is really amazing to see how many things it can do. First time alexa integration is a smooth process. Voice recognition is perfect. It will take few days to get used to it and then, you will become the Commander.Kids will love to play with alexa. There are many skills such as ""panda rescue"" and story telling which they can enjoy.MUSIC  is the best part of it, if you love music then you can explore lots of songs, uninterruptedly. Speaker quality is quite good.Moreover, I was surprised to to see that alexa can also control the FireStick tv. It can search, play, pause, rewind, forward, at least in primevideo, netflix and youtube. Loved this feature, completely hands-free ""alexa + FireStick""  experience""",0,5

188,Venkatakrishnan,2019-10-08,Decent enough smart speaker,"The sound quality and Bluetooth connectivity is awesome for such a small device. First and foremost thing to do after buying is to check the marketplace of your Amazon account. If it is global (. com), we have to send request to Amazon help team to change to (.in), otherwise, gaana, jiosaavn or even an android TV bought in india cannot be connected. However, Mostly can't recognize many words and skills in gaana and jio saavn.",1,4
189,Sriram,2020-10-22,One star for the Hardware and nothing for the Software!,"Bad software! Alexa is not smart at all.voice recognition is not accurate most of the times but more than that Alexa interpretation leaves lot to be desired. Alexa is a just NLP and works on plain if else or a switch condition rather than being smart device. No where follows the user pattens, voice patterns and the people to come up with suggestions. Most of the times you get fed up with the results and then switch off the device. Mostly none of the songs I want will be played, I end up using it for casting the music from the phone, which anyways normal Bluetooth speaker will do at a less price.Hardly any useful tricks as they call it!Just works as voice command based device rather than a smart speaker!",0,1
190,Kindle Customer,2020-11-24,The most powerful addition of AI to your life,"It's simply amazing. Before I bought it, it sounded like a simple music player to me, but this is much more than that. When you are alone, it can be your best companion. It's a great learning tool for kids and a device that can replace various functions of your mobile phone. You can use it to play meditation music when you get up in the morning and it will help you attain focus. In short, it simplifies the search options on the Internet and helps you live a smart lifestyle.",0,5
191,Tuxanlee,2019-05-23,A bit disappointing experience,"Kind of works, but not enough. Product make and the sound quality are good. Aux-out was a major reason to choose Alexa over G-Home. Basic stuff like alarm/timer etc are okay. But that is it.Many times the device doesnt listen to me, specially when it is playing music. And I end up calling 'Alexa"" 3-4 times going closer each time to get the 'attention'. If I had to go all the while to the equipment to say 'Next' or 'reduce volume', what is the benefit over any normal music player !And when it listens, it recognizes wrong atleast half of the time. Initially I thought it is with the regional language (song/movie name), but then found the problem with perfect English dictionary words also (Mercury as Fury and MP3 as MPA). My accent must be really bad !So basically i have to struggle for minutes to get an intended song played.I did get the PLEX server setup in my PC to stream local music to alexa. Not at a level of selecting songs with voice commands yet, but atleast I get a playlist of my choice played.Most of the time I have to use specific commands itself. Natural Language Processing seems far far away. You will need a lot of patience to deal with Alexa !",2,2
192,Sanyam jain,2020-07-24,I love Alexa skills,Skills which I like specifically are:1. PanchTantra: 100s of Indian stories for kids2. Mein Tota hare rang ka - Indian Rhyme3.

(Have same background noice of fan/Vehicles)Amazon please send a software update which solves these.Thanks!",1,4
194,Yogesh Hindoliya,2019-07-18,Brilliant product,"So, I bought this off Prime day sale along with a Syska 9W Smart LED Bulb (which is the most stupid product ever).Anyway about Echo Dot. I am a software developer myself and I work day-in day-out with AI and ML products. I must say the quality and the capabilities of Echo Dot + Alexa are just mind boggling. I can understand the amount of work that has gone into it's development. Amazing Product. If you really want a good personal assistant, please do but this.There is a limited set of things Alexa can do but for professionals, it's really great at whatever it does including but not limited to organising your tasks, appointments as well as reminders.As for the ""Smart"" Syska LED that came with the package, that product is ultimate disgrace to the brand. It's such a disgrace that it's review I have to write here because Amazon has shut down reviews on the actual product. FMLCheers,Y",1,5
195,Dinesh,2018-11-21,Good one.......,"Purchased during sale in Rs. - 2500/- so got very good deal. but received after almost 15 days.- First time Connection to WiFi network is headache.

197,Unbiased Reviewer,2019-01-21,Powerful AI speaker.,"This is indeed an improvement over the 2nd gen. But, a lot needs to be done in the machine learning part. 8 out of 10 ttimes, it understands but not as good as Google Home. I saw one of the reviewers on here bashing other reviewers saying that most of them don't know about sound quality in speakers. I don't agree with that. I agree with others who say this has a good quality of bass. For the price, you get an AI powered speaker with powerful sound. Go for it. This purchase will not be regretted.",1,4

On the next day itself it says (return recieved) and it was the mistake of courier service and amazon. But when I called the customer service, they ensured me that the placed it again with the same price. But still the status on my dashboard wasn't updated. So I called to customer service again, and he too said same. After 4-5 days I called again, and now they are saying that nothing is updated and I have to place the order again(with today's price). Then what's amazon prime for?! If they can't sell their own product in a wise way.. So disappointing.it was a gift for my brother. And it delayed again. I need a clear action from Amazon service with this matter.",0,1

It's four far field microphones makes the Alexa experience quite impressive. It is better than google mini home overall, Like it has beeter sound quality better response with natural voice and room filling sound. It has really many features and there are list of pros. But there are two things which disappoints me that first is it's voice recognition. It answers anyone. Secondly you can't make calls from Alexa within India. but well Alexa is adding skills on the daily basis.",1,5

202,Dr. URVISH MISTRY,2020-11-28,A Perfect Device with Minor Inconveniences,"This was my second echo dot purchase. However, everything is similar to the first one, I find this one a tad bit quicker to answer queries. I do not know the reason nor can I find one for it to be.Meanwhile, white color is totally white and can be a bit problem if you're using it in a broad open space which may cause it to get dirty from dust.The voice recognition is perfect. However, like Google Nest Home devices, I would like personalized results from voice identification. That would certainly give these device lineup an edge.Spotify device casting is excellent. I find it faster than Google devices. The sound is a bit muffled though due to side firing (?) speaker. I believe one should go for 4th Gen devices from now on.Home automation is a breeze with these devices. I've set up multi room audio and it's one thing that I can say is worth all the money. You may also set up two dots as stereo speakers too.Overall, this is a great device. Just bear in mind, 4th gen is a remarkable improvement over this one.",0,5

205,RT,2019-08-02,Powerful speaker than its predecessor.,"Edit after using for one month.Initially I had hurdles in getting it to wake with our wake word. Due to less sensitive mic than its predecessor.

Switched back to old Echo DotI was very happy with Echo Dot old version plastic black one with only concern being speaker volume is limited. Brought this one 3rd Gen and found its voice recognition to be very bad than its predecessor. Often I had to shout to make it listen giving rise to a lot of nuisance to others around and throat pain.

But is a terrible let down if looking for smart capabilities , mostly coz Alexa isn't as smart or conversive like the Google assistant. It's a smart speaker which isn't really smart. If your looking for music only that then go ahead,but then if your only looking for music go in for JBL or other Bluetooth speakers. Else go for Google home mini.

Plus the reduced price due to sale and a nice smart bulb for just 500 rupees. Overall I think this was super value for money. I haven't used any other smart speaker before but I am very happy with my purchase. Below are some observations :1. Initially it feels a bit weird talking to a speaker but you get used to it in no time.2. The sound quality is pretty good. You get good depth of sound with decent bass.3. Several skills available and you will definitely find some very useful. For example adding stuff to shopping list or setting up a reminder.4. Understands the Indian accent very well. Sometimes I am amazed by how well it picks up stuff.6. Kids love it. An added advantage is that they can take help for homework and talking to alexa also motivates them to talk in English,1,5

The muisc and the bass is very well balanced for a soothing music experience.Also, music streaming platforms like Amazon Prime Muisc and Saavn are also available to play music from. So, need to connect the device with your phone. Instead ask Alexa to play any music, playist or album of your choice.However Aexa mobile app can be improved but that is nothing much to do with the amazing performance of this very device.

Connectivity and comfort is. Bought it for 2,999; after which it even went for 2,499 for a few days.

235,Rinu Shri Garg,2020-10-05,Just one drawback,"The only drawback that it has is that it's non-chargeable. You are supposed to plug in everytime you want to use it. Also, since it has a limited cloud data on which it searches for the songs you are looking for, it sometimes is unable to find some lesser known songs. I tried a few songs, used the name of singer as well, but it wasn't able to find the correct one. Other than that, it's perfect.",2,5

The major difference between second generation and third generation echo dot is.. the sound which is very high in echo dot and also it has 5 microphones so even if the music is loud alexa work can be heard easily. At 2999 introduction priceIts a steal deal. Did lot of stuff like booking pkayed quiz beside playing only songs.,6,5

238,nikhil sachan,2020-12-21,A perfect companion,"I love my echo dot device. There some things, which are really good like whisper command. I am using google mini for last 1 year, it is also really good but some diff are really noteworthy. I am living in hostel so I don’t want to disturb my neighbour student in night when I command my echo ,which is far from my bed to switch off my light. In google I have to shout (not loud but still enough) in echo I can just whisper, and it responds every single time.  The second thing is during switching off or switching on the light ,  google repeat the full name of my light for example it shouts ” switching on Nikhil Syska bulb” during night if you have forgotten to lower the volume suddenly you will call google “ switch of the light “ it will shout back “ switching off Nikhil Syska bulb “ but echo dot just say “ok” which way more convenient.Though when it comes to connecting to laptop automatically the scenario is totally opposite , google connects silently just making a ping sound and echo repeats my lappy name.The other thing is buttons in place of touch . I like buttons in place of touch , which make its tough to pick the google , most of the time either it play/ pause the songs or increase / decrease the volume . If I have voice assistance, why would I need touch 🙄.Alexa integration- because I use amazon shoping and I have kindle , the integration is very much useful for me . My echo reads my book for me . It remind me if my order is coming today.Portability - it’s shape makes it less beautiful but good in portability. It fits in my bag so conveniently  just ignore the dangling cable.",0,5

Adding things to your cart on Amazon, playing truth and dare, organizing GK and Bollywood quiz tournaments, you name it and it can do it.

While the first gen gave me enough time for me to speak, these would just cut me off if i stuttered while the command,.. They wont give the beep echo dot first had while changing volume.Overall the user experience is downgraded while the build and sound quality improved by a good margin!

286,Amazon Customer,2020-10-20,Worth the price and feature.... must have device for all your smart needs.,The best you can get...served the purpose to next levelI bought this Alexa dot 3rd generation just to try out how it works.(my first wifi device)What I got:1. Haven’t tried other portable speakers yet but can’t ask for better sound quality... it’s amazing.2. Easily connected with amazon fire stick .... you command and it serves..like playing any track or movies on amazon prime and Netflix3. Connects with iPhone or android mobile and any Bluetooth speaker and turns your normal Bluetooth speaker of your choice to a smart speaker( used on f&d 6000 using Bluetooth audio adopter)4. Got the combo deal with Wipro 12w smart bulb at 2349 during sale and magic begins.5. At high volume Alexa recognise your voice command like anything.6. Ask Alexa for ordering foods and cab service( although not available to my place) but it gives you proper information.7. Connects even on using mobile hotspot with jio connection.Thank you amazon for such an nice product.PS: Delivery at remote place in Punjab within 48 hrs of order and thanks to delivery person who came at 8 o’clock in the morning.,0,5
287,Ninosha,2019-10-09,Nice,"I got it on sale. It's perfect for my room. I've hooked it up by a cable to my Bluetooth speaker. I only wished it worked on battery. Having said that I did have trouble with it once, when it wouldn't connect to the wifi on resetting the device. It took me more than a day to figure it out. The help provided by Amazon Customer services in relation to Alexa devices on speaking to them seemed like I would get a replacement but keep in mind that it's not so, you will be offered a refund but not a replacement as far as my experience is concerned. Thankfully I got my product to work before the agent came to collect it.",0,5
288,Robin Raj,2021-07-02,Great product with nice feature but repair of this product is not possible in India,"The product is really good and works fine as per the expectation.Though the proble is once it gets hardware proble as in my case due to fluctuation in power, speaker of my device got damaged. Then I had sent it for repair but in india they can't open the device and repair it hece I was offered to buy refurbished decice at 2000 with just 3 months warranty hence it is like almost paying for a new device with just 3 month of warranty rather than 12 months. Again once 3 month is over for the refurbished device you are on your own if device gets any fault. Hence the vecious cycle of buying refurbished item or new device will continue as there is no option to repair in India.  Hence over dependency on this item will invite this unavoidable vecious circle.",0,4

294,Dhiren,2020-09-19,There is no difference in New Alexa,"What is improved from the earlier generation? My feeling is Amazon need to enrich skills at the backend and ""any generation Alexa"" could use them seamlessly.  Also required is the isolation mode - where in Alexa can be configured to do only specific skills rather than responding to  noise (conversation not directed for Alexa - e.g. you are referring to Alexander the Great and Alexa in the room starts speaking and disturbing)..",0,3
295,Indian,2019-11-05,"Great product, but still quite dumb","Amazon echo dot is a great product in terms of its sound quality and overall entertainment value. But for practical use it is still quite dumb. For Indians we definitely need to set English and Hindi together. Also many common things it does in a dumbest way. Many Indian songs it doesn't understand correctly. Variations in news, scores, horoscopes, weather are just missing.Long way to go for this technology. In many ways google assistant is better. I hope that same device should allow marriage of all the technologies in this field.",0,4
296,Sidhartha Bitla,2019-05-25,Good,Looks wise the product looks amazing. Audio quality is good. Voice Recognition is very bad. Some times if we are so close it won't respond. It has a limited library of songs so it won't give you the expected song to play. If we ask for some favorite song to play it plays some other song. This should be updated. Amazon music should update huge list of songs to resolve the issue.,0,4
297,Sudeep,2019-10-25,A long way to go to be truly Smart.,"No wonder Amazon has tried hard to make this speaker smart but it fails to expect as per the aura which has been built around this product.At most this is a 'Smart Music Player' and not a smart assistant. The alexa needs to improve a lot. Alexa responds only to simplest of requests and responce in a little twisted scenario goes out for a six.Voice quality of speaker is good. The recognition capacity of Microphone is outstanding.Overall it is a safe purchase and can be bought. I hope Amazon improves it over a period of time. (Yes, I mean a lot).",0,3

302,Arpit,2019-12-03,Smart but not enough,"Alexa is good in understanding the Indian accent and covering Hindi-English language , it does the job of voice assistant in terms of managing devices around... I tried controlling my Denon AVR X2500h with Alexa, it does the basic task of paying song, changing volume, but can't change the music mode etc. Similarly I can control my Airtel Internet TV set top box once set-top box is swith on, it can not swith it on or off.So it gets the work done upto certain extend but not completely.The biggest problem which is see with Echo devices is that it can not get the information from web though it is connected to internet always, for every thing to do it needs skill.Ideally it should go to web to find some basic answers instead of saying ""I don't know"".If anyone wants to use it just for playing music then this is one of the best smart speaker available in market in given price.",0,4

Though Echo may not always find the Telugu songs we intend it to play, we can find the song in Amazon music app and play it once, Echo will pick it. We have to give the song details as per the song info showing in Amazon music app. We keep Echo on top of our fridge to keep it out of reach of my 3 year old. Sometimes it will not catch our commands, so we have to turn it so that it's microphone hears our commands clearly. It is good that Echo can read a story to my kid, from the same page we last read in our Kindle. Overall happy with it.",0,5

Adding to the woes is the electronic items from Amazon which is not a specialist in such items also magnified my negative images for such devices.My eleder brother ordered this device for his use and the lockdown offered me some time to spend with my family including Alexa device.  I am writing the review after regular two week use of the devices and my feedback is followingPros-Timely delivery by Amazon.Great packing.Easy to setup the device.Amazing sound quality, I was amazed to see that a pocket fitting devices can produce such loud and clear output.Very prompt reply from the device upon any request.Multi language support.Works very fluently with the mobile hotspot.Smart home integration is awesome.ConsAlexa gets upset sometimes as housewife's do.

I have a Google Home and it used to disconnect a lot and this device is pretty decent and working fine so far.The additional advantage is Aux output so I can connect to my boom box so get the Alexa features with my speakers.The pairing of speakers, I don't know why I can't pair my other Bluetooth device with this? Why Amazon is not allowing this ..? Whether it will be considered in the future release?Alexa app seems to be better than Google Home App, where you have a very limited option and no one knows what kind of skills that google home has by default.",0,4

  Its awesome in some cases. Its big as my palm. Nice build quality. Some features needed to be upgraded. App needs upgradation. Voice recognition is so good. Convert your voice to text is so fast and accurate. Search result is so fast. But some times it goes out of control. While playing music it can not hear your voice. Your need to shout then. Some time i asked to record and it turns on my light. Good futurastic product but still need to work on it more. App is not up to that mark. Alexa is smart but app isn’t. Packaging is good. Delivery was on time. Buttons are nice. Lights are so good to eyes. Sound is not loud or balanced to replace my other Bluetooth speaker. Sounds boomy. Need youtube skill urgently.",0,3

Finding music is very difficult we ask something it plays something else, doesn't play different versions of song if available, doesn't take feedback on content. A lot of improvements needed.

315,John,2020-09-09,Brilliant Product,"I got this one during the Prime day sale. I have used this for a month now and below is my review.Pros:1. Excellent Speaker - both as a standalone speaker and smart device (at the price point i got on Prime day)2. Alexa - Has almost no trouble in recognizing voice and very rarely does it falter, plus integration with Amazon ecosystem - You can place order, track deliveries and also receive news updates all via Eco dot.3.  Bluetooth - Can even use this as a blue-tooth speaker for iPad / Phone . Does a great job (needs power source though)Cons:1. Portability : A removable USB cable on adapter would have enabled much wider usage (battery bank power?)2. One command at a time - It cannot execute 2 or 3 commands in one go - Like switch on the light, & play music will need you to say ""Alexa"" 2 times.  Can be a bit abrupt at times - in starting and stopping music etc.Verdict : Brilliant smart speaker for home use at a great price point.",0,5
316,anc,2019-11-20,Works best for my toddler,"Got it for 2,204.09 + 5% cashback along with free ""smart"" wipro light bulb.

Alexa is well integrated and Alexa does the job of playing songs for my toddler and parents quiet well. (This is what it is being used for 90% of the time). Alexa is not as smart as google, but for intended purpose, serves us well.Tried to pair with my firestick, could pair it easily but the fire stick uses this as output device by default, instead of tv speakers and there is noticeable lag between video on tv and sound through echo dot. Does not have option to stream audio through tv speakers and use echo dot just as remote for voice commands. So for now I have unpaired the firestick and the echo dot. Hopefully future updates may fix this. (Lag between video audio would be a very hard thing to fix, but there should be an option to use echo dot as just a voice remote)",0,5

Now I can connect my speakers via multiple devices wirelessly and even can control the volume without physically touch the buttons. This was a much needed upgrade for my speakers, and I loved it.I have not separately tested the sound quality of Echo Dot (3rd Gen), but it is definitely better than the 2nd Gen one. It catches up the voice commands really easily far away from the room even when there is ambient noise present. It also has great bluetooth connectivity, can connect over long ranges without any distortion. One downside I faced while playing movies over bluetooth from my PC is, there is a bit of lag in the sound; but it is very intermittent.",0,5

Both have display and work fine. I want to buy Echo Dot from longtime but didn’t buy it as there was no good sale going on.Recently, Amazon put combo deal offer for Rs 5499 which includes  Echo Dot(3rd generation), Oakter smart switch  6A, HD fire tv stick. So I would say it’s worth every single penny.Reasons1) If you have prime membership then buy this combo pack during sale day. I got around 56 percent discount. Echo devices can help you with smart switches, smart lights, smart ac, etc. But, if you don’t have prime membership then don’t buy.2). You can control your tv using fire tv stick through echo devices using voice command.So, you need both to perform such task. But incase, you have low budget then I suggest you to buy fire tv. It has built in alexa and can perform smart devices task. But, remember you need to buy subscription separately for fire tv streaming application.3) Oakter switch is not worth the Mrp but if you get a combo deal at good price then buy it. It doesn’t require hub and has it’s own application.",0,5

Much better sound quality. Its charging pin is different. It does not use the 5volts micro usb to power-up , it instead uses a 12volt round pin. So you cannot use the power charger on any other device. I liked the older power adapter.

It cannot recognize voice with low volume from a distance more than a 1.5 m2. It cannot Understand and Play many Telugu songs. It only suggests songs which are available on the music app which you have kept default or amazon music.3.Bluetooth connection with the device very difficult to set up if you have not used it for a while4. Changing a Wifi Network takes a lot of time. Every time u need to enter set up mode ( Orange Color light with pressing dot button ). It is better if we can directly change from app.,0,3

332,Arijit Adak,2020-09-19,Good but needs lots of improvements to match google assistant or Siri,"When I first brought this product I loved this but after 2 months of use I had to reset it as it could not connect to internet and to set-up for 2nd time it took me 2 hours as really could not connect to internet.The main problem for this device is, if there is no internet then its a dumb box, could not do anything. This is nowhere mentioned in the product description. Also if you have multiple internet connection, it cannot save 2 or more internet connections which could be connected when one is not working and this is my main disappointment. I would not comment on sound quality as there are much more products at this price range which has greater sound quality.Speech recognition is very good, but most of the times it interprets wrong for which song I need. This is irritating most of the times and then I switch to mobile app to play the right song, so having alexa and having a normal bluetooth speaker for me is same, no value addition. Hoping Amazon will improve its AI features a lot like google or Siri.",0,2

When i bought Alexa, lot of expectations , but it is not at all impressive on various areas, like when I ask Alexa to play malayalam songs , based on movies,singers,by song name, it is always gives an answer sorry I could not see any song. Same stands with Tamil and to an extend hindi songs as well.Google Home is much smarter and better choice than Aelxa.

339,Dr.Amit,2019-09-10,After buying echo dot you will purchase google home.,Most important thing is that Google home is like Android phone you can install any software and Amazon echo dot is like apple you will pay for heavy installation charges. Alexa didn't do anything without help of other software.Sometimes I feel amazon made echo dot to promote amazon prime membership customer.so if you want to use Alexa you will purchase Amazon Prime membership and many more so so be ready for investing more money to Alexa after buying Alexa.ONE MORE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN GOOGLE HOME AND ECHO DOT IS LANGUAGE.GOOGLE CAN SPEAK AND UNDERSTAND HINDI PERFECTLY AND ECHO DOT UNDERSTAND ONLY ENGLISH.,0,3
340,Abhishek,2020-06-27,power package !!!!,this is a good product i chose it over google mini nest because it was cheaper and it contains a auxiliary port as well for output . Sound quality is good unless you have a very big room then you might want to connect external speakers. spotify works just fine . Not able to integrate saavn as of now . Some songs it cannot find and you ought to say the movie name or something like that for it to recognize.Apart from that it controls my light well. Very good buy i liked it enough !!!!.,1,4

343,Rajdeep,2020-02-25,A very handy tool in a busy life.,"A must have product in your room. It does understand English and Hindi questions and queries better than 'Google Home' and also the sound quality is excellent when compared. Bluetooth feature comes very handy and notification light-blinking is also a great way. Better build quality than the previous generations. Featured skills are also available on the Alexa app including the Alexa-calling and broadcasting features. Mic is also very responsive too. Bass of the speaker is sufficient for a medium-sized room. Only issue is that with the manual buttons on the top which ""for my taste"" looks very ugly. Although if looks are not the priority then it is THE BEST buy in the smart-speaker segment today.",0,5

347,Gaurav Bansal,2019-03-31,Best in class but there are still many issues,"Its a superb product by Amazon. Although it is overpriced product in my view just because basically for music, news etc. We are spending 4.5 K that really not worth as true price for that product would be 2.5 K considering it's good speakers, echo , bass etc. Its good innovation but it is on developing phase because of following:-1. As many a times Alexa find difficulties to understand our language2. Not many options available for exploring in music only ganna and savaan is available.3. The Amazon Alexa app is the worst, as in case Alexa didn't get the song you are willing to listen, so you can't search that particular song on app4. There is no voice locking system as anybody can change the music by giving command5. Works well with WiFi only .6. You have to connect all time with power plug. No other option. So if lights have gone then it's of no use. Biggest disadvantage I guess because we light shortage is biggest problem n we listen to music/news etc. Only when there is no lights .",1,3

  Iam liking this product, build quality is excellent and very nice.it has very sensitive response and that's good it has so many applications u can try and that's nice.Pros:-- u can also run this using mobile hotspot.- specker-sounds is very nice, u can also connect ur sound bar or speaker with aux or blutooth and WiFi.- u can make ur room smart using wifi enable plus, modulus and light's.Cons:-- it has only hindi as india language.-it don't stream music form youtube music.-i start playing Christian songs in hindi then after some songs it plays Hindu songs.-at first it's bit complicated to understand.- u have to buy smart WiFi modulus to use its applications or it's normal speaker with ai virtual assistant.I bought this in bundle with oakter-remote at just 2800 inr in prime day deal.

363,Rohit Verma,2019-09-29,Good as a novelty for kids,"Horrible music sound. Only good for speeches or weather reports, not for music. Bluetooth connectivity is a pain if you have multiple devices. Stationary use only (no battery). If you go and plug in another room, for example from living room to bedroom you have to start connectivity again from scratch. Alexa software is ages behind Google voice. I am returning this product. Good for a novelty, although you can get better items to show off for that price. Could not even recognize Gurgaon. Don’t be fooled by 3rd generation... just some more fancy lights. If the price drops after you buy it and take it somewhere else.

365,NC,2020-09-29,Unrelated but necessary to know about AMAZON'S after sale and warranty service. Be warned.,"This is the second time that I have had to purchase this product, my first echo dot device stopped working and since it was not in warranty I was advised by AMAZON to send it to their CTDI team which handles out of warranty devices. My experience with CTDI has been nothing short of a nightmare. The CTDI team is impossible to contact, they do not respond to emails and their phone service does not work. After having my device for nearly 5 months , I was sent a redicolous high estimate for repair which costs as much as a  new device itself. Not only that , the email coatation is for a fire stick when I sent them an echo dot device. Again no clarification received from them till date even though I have sent a second reminder.My reason to go into such details is that one should never waste ones time with CTDI and what is even more shocking is AMAZON'S attitude once your device is out of warranty.AMAZON arrogantly washes their hands of you and your problem .",0,1

Google home ll give you more accurate answers and follw up conservation. Alexa properly dnt deals with follow up multiple questions. Amazon music dnt have more collections lik spotify, wynk.

378,Rahul Gautam,2020-06-21,Absolutely horrifying experience,"Extremely bad experience with Amazon- Bought this with in combo with fire tv stick and Wipro bulb for 7098 rs. My three previous fire sticks were all for 2600rs during sale instead of 4000rs. This time I was willing to pay 4000 for the stick as echo dot I was getting for 3029 and Wipro bulb for like 100 bucks (699rs otherwise).- Echo dot ran fine for first 3-4 days then I faced mic issues a few times. I felt could be because of other noises, ceiling fan perhaps.- I then tried to run specific lists e.g. I went to Amazon music app, saw the playlist I wanted to play. I asked echo dot to play that list from Amazon music. Instead it kept playing random playlists and a few times it mentioned it didn't recognise that list even though it was right there in front of me on the phone.- I emailed cs for above issue, no response till date. Been 7 days.- As a workaround, I decided to play music from app rather and then cast it on Echo Dot. It kept showing connecting (blue circle kept rolling) but nothing ever happened. Means cast option also didn't work. Being a techie myself, I performed all tech articles from Google, reset device etc., Checked location, what not. Finally, I rang cs and they perfomed a few troubleshooting which didn't work. They informed I would be contacted in 24-48 hours. I mentioned replacement window ends after 48 hours and I want response by then. Wasn't too keen in going for replacement and trouble people so agreed to wait for 48 hours window.- to my surprise, it's been 3 days now, no response. I called cs. Was asked to wait for 48 more hours. I asked for supervisor. He came on call and asked me to wait for his team to perform troubleshooting. I had lost it by then. I asked for replacement and after huge hold and verbal discussions to and fro, supervisor agreed for replacement. But informed I'd be informed in a few hours.- I checked now, I am being issued refund and it cost me 500 rs setback. Whole logic of bundle and save money was absolutely rubbish and Amazon support really destroyed the overall experience.- Having bought items worth in lacs, I wonder if it was all worth it.",0,2

You can call it from the hall even if it is in your bedroom! It actually even stops to Listen to you when you're having a conversation with the word ""Alexa""... (Very good Alexa integration)Here's my crazy story: I loved echo dot so much that I thought I'd immediately upgrade to echo show.. I returned this and got that . The Alexa integration on show.. is.. nothing compared to dot..it was extremely disappointing 😂. So, I returned show to buy echo dot again.. and.. the offer period was over by then! 😂😂😂Waiting for the next offer to get echo dot third generation.",0,5
390,Shekhar,2021-03-15,Buy it with confidence,"Echo dot is a wonderful piece of equipment and luckily got it on a heavily discounted price of 2999. I read a lot of reviews and even negative reviews , lot of comparisons with google mini etc. I don't understand if there is a delivery related issue why to give a negative review for product. I already had a battery based portable JBL charge blue tooth speaker. This was something new for me.  Based on usage for last two days- Sound quality is good enough to fill a room of 15x12 feet size. you will enjoy it.- Accepted voice command with perfection never missed. (even when music is playing on high)- Finish quality of product is superb.- For trials paid my gas bills effortlessly.- I am not into smart LED's but plan to try them also- Three exciting colors to choose from, I took the purple one.- Was easily paired with mobile to be used as a blue tooth speaker.- Thousands of skills are there to be explored and used.I will recommend this product definitely in today's scene where people are into work from home kind of setup.",0,5

It helps in converting your home into a smart home, with various devices connect and operated through it.Kids love playing with Alexa Voice AI assistant. They seem to be having more fun 😁😁.The voice quality is pretty decent for it size, and is adequate to pleasurable listening . Amazon prime membership takes the experience a notch higher with access to Amazon Play Music Library, which I must say is quite well equiped.

Its very annoying when YouTube music works flawless, sadly there is no inter-compatibility with each other.Also why cant I change the voice, it sounds so robotic, make a better alternative, its one thing that's keeping me away from making it my default voice assistant.Everything else is just great. Sound has much more depth. Google home mini is tuned for better vocal response while echo is for music",0,4

And yes you can configure too in the Alexa app if you’d like.Next, is the build quality. It is really good and feels firm. Bluetooth and wi-fi connectivity is awesome. Best part is I can connect it to my phone & laptop and use it as an external speaker.The only downside for me is Alexa. She needs a lot of improvement in terms of knowledge. Basic things are carried out pretty well like reminders, alarms, music, etc. however, when it comes to answering questions she fails most of the time.Tip: Keep adding skills in the Alexa app for improvement.",0,4
397,Dev S.,2019-06-16,Not worth the money spend. Takes peace and patience away.,Super poor product. No doubt Amazon has to offer discounts to push it. Previous generation echo was better. Mic quality is pathetic. It does not listen to you if the volume is had been maxed up. Claims about Alexa following commands from other end of room are false. It fails to work from 3 feet as well. Super poor product not worth 10% of its price. Feel Disappointed and cheated,1,1
398,Harish Kumar,2019-10-15,Good but need some AI improvements,"As a speaker, it has a very good loudness and I got it for only ₹1,999 which is a very good price for this type of speaker. Sound quality is very good and crystal clear.But as a smart speaker it need a lot of improvements. Sometimes it doesn't understand very simple questions and sentences. Sometimes it will not play the song you are telling it to play, it plays a song with similar name. Sometimes you will need to tell song's singer, and movie etc to play songs, which according to me ruins the experience.It need a lot of AI improvements. If you are looking for a very smart speaker then go for Google Home mini or Google Home. It will not satisfy you as a AI but it has better sound quality then Google home mini and it connects with a lot of smart devices which google home mini can't. The choice is yours.Good Speaker :- Echo DotGood AI :- Google Home mini",0,4

The design is great and sturdy with good quality speakers which deliver great sound. The sensitivity of the mic is also superb.. Thanks to the 4 built in mics..The only downside which I found was the adapter which was not a micro USB.. But can't complain as the speakers need extra juice which cannot be delivered by a micro USB.. (maybe)..Anyway overall it was a great buy..,0,5

  The echo dot is an incredibly awesome amazon product.Talking about the sound quality, the sound quality is beyond expectation for me, its crystal clear and quite loud as compared to its size. Alexa integration is great, it can do things like movie tickets booking, can book a cab, it can easily be linked to apple music or other streaming services, can read news and specially it can understand hindi which is awesome. Talking about the 4 mics integrated in the device. These mics works just awesome, it does not matter how loud the music is or how far you are from alexa in a room, all you have to do is say “Alexa” and she activates. The best part is it does not matter how much noise in the environment, she can hear you. Echo dot can be easily linked to other devices.It also works with almost all the smart home devices.( smart bulbs, hubs, microwave, etc)*Note: Echo dot requires a high-speed wifi connection (more than 20Mbps) for better experience. It also requires permanent power supply. If you need a portable echo dot you can go for the portable one which was launched in December 2019.",0,5

Built quality is very nice and far ahead of hey google----------------After using for about 6 months, My opinion about Alexa is fantastic and quite useful.Now I am two wifi smart bulbs and Alexa is good at receiving instructions.If we ask for specific song we have to be more precise in asking otherwise we have to repeat the processWhile reading from  audible it is becoming difficult to instruct to go to particular Page. Some pages we may read and some through audibleI love Alexa. Hundreds of skills can be utilised.  Go for it with out any second thoughtReview at the time purchase----------------------------------Fantastic.  Able to understand commands. But on the day of installation we found a bit difficult.  But as we got used to it ,now we are feeling more comfortable.Suggestions..  Still Alexa has to improve in general knowledge section.  Alexa is staring immediately after the wake up word Alexa.. It has to wait for the last word of the command.Example.. If I ask to say about Hrithik Roshan, Instead of saying about Hrithik Roshan it starts playing Hrithik Roshan songs. Even news section also , previously read news paper only it is reading again.But once got used to it ,then it is amazing experience.  Go for it right now.  Sound quality is awesome. Play with it continuously, then you will come to know how to make use of Alexa.",0,5

It would be better if we can type the song to be played as it doesn't recognize a lot of songs through voice commands. Needs high speed Internet to function properly.

Good interpretation of the command, per se.Expectations:1. Acceptance of English and Hindi command simultaneously.2. Offering choices of singers when a particular song is sung by many artists. At present, it always starts with the same artist.3. Offering choices of different starting points and sequences. E.g. for a command of ""Bhajan"" or ""instrumental lullabies"" it starts with the same song/music and proceeds with the same sequence. Soon it becomes monotonous. This needs improvement4. Identifying voices of the members of the family and offering their types of music. With its excellent ability of identifying voice it seems to be easy to recognize and remember voice by names of the family members (and the rest by guest). Remembering choices of the family members and offering music accordingly would be expected. Obviously, a reset option is must in such cases.",0,4
422,Mukul,2021-08-29,Overrated product,"Overall product is ok. But I'm not happy with the price and Alexa integration. She can recognize your voice from approx 10m of a distance. However, the recommendations/ suggestions provided by Alexa is not satisfactory. I mostly listen to music and the choices she makes are inexact. I mean idk how she come up with lame songs. For example, i have asked for Hollywood songs, she sometimes starts playing bhojpuri songs 😕😕, additionally i have asked her to repeat what i have asked and she replies the correct sentence, and that's more strange.Anyways, price comparing to product, price is too high i bought it for 2500 and i would be happy to buy it for approx 1500. But, more than 2000 is unacceptable for Alexa.Trust me, I regret buying this product. Also, it's not even wireless 🙄🙄🙄. It's app is too heavy which makes it too slow and so on.If you earn Luke crazy money, go for it... It's good for show off. However, if you are that person who thinks before buying, DON'T. BUY. IT.

Amazing form factor and design, above average far-field speech recognition feature, and WHAT A SOUND!! One Star for extra only for the sound. Otherwise, the general Alexa capabilities are more or less the same across all Echo devices. The smart-home features are absolute fun to use too. Summing up, this device is a MUST BUY for music lovers, thanks to an unending list of accessible songs sourced through Amazon Music, Saavn and other 3rd party music streaming services.

434,Tanuj Kumar,2019-08-21,Not worth to buy,"Don't buy it and don't get attracted towards the hype about Amazon Echo or Google home. It will not answer to your in general query. And moreover to control your things such as bulb, fan etc you will have to buy those separately that adds additional burden to your pocket. I bought it after hearing a lot about it and I got angry when I felt that it will not work until and unless you connect your Amazon Echo to any wifi network. It also adds another monthly burden to your pocket. Even after spending a lot you will struggle while using it because it will not answer your daily query. I will tell you about my personal experience I asked alexa to remember my birthday and surprisingly it said ""Sorry I didn't know that"". And also I asked alexa to roar like a lion and it did but it was like someone play a low quality audio. I think you would have seen that in one of the advertisement. So last but not the least if you use it regularly you will conclude that you are using Amazon echo just for 2-3 works, playing music (also sound quality is loud but not good) adding alarm and controlling led bulbs if you have bought. So I will suggest you to think wisely because by the time you will decide it is not worth to buy your return period will be over. And if you will ask to me I will say DON'T BUY it rather buy a JBL speaker and it will give you satisfaction whenever you will listen any song.",1,1

I was happy to see my kids doing their home work with it. Kids also gaining general knowledge with it. One of the must items for the home.

If you are song addict this is good for you, I mainly use it for setting up alarm as and when required with just a voice message to Alexa. One you have configured your voice profile through Alexa app it will recognise your voice very easily The best thing with Alexa is you need to say Alexa to let the device hear you instead of ""ok google"" in home google devices which is comparatively easier. Two things which I was completely unaware before purchasing the device that it needs to be continuously connected to power supply to work as it doesn't have any inbuilt battery and second it requires WiFi connection to work.",0,4

450,Santosh John Ross,2019-10-08,Best Amazon product as on date,Just the uniqueness of the speaker and the ease of getting information and hearing songs.This is a must buy among all amazon products. Dont think twice just get it its awesome. Prerequisite is good wifi connection at home. Please note this speaker has to be connected to a powersource and the power block and cable is included n the box. Also amazon prime membership is a must.

451,Manu Goyal,2021-05-06,Connectivity Issue Everytime with Distorted Sound.,"I purchased Amazon Alexa 3rd Generation in November 2020. Since, April 2021 whenever I connect my phone through Bluetooth and play something on it through my phone, the sound that comes from it is distorted.And then I asked for help from amazon. They told me to purchase the same new device since it's a COVID pandemic, so I agreed and bought a new device, and when the device delivered to me after 4 days it was also having the same issue as the previous one, so I called in Amazon help services and registered a complaint, they told me to pair another mobile through Bluetooth so I paired during the phone call to Amazon helpline and played something on it, then it was working perfectly alright, but when I played through the new paired mobile on next day the sound was distorted.I recommend not to buy this device.",0,2

I love music so whenever I ask her to play my favourite song, she plays it very well.  I haven't used any other smart speaker before but I am very happy with my purchase. Below are some observations : 1. Initially it feels a bit weird talking to a speaker but you get used to it in no time. 2. The sound quality is pretty good. You get good depth of sound with decent bass. 3. Several skills are available and you will definitely find some very useful. For example adding stuff to shopping list or setting up a reminder. 4. Understands the Indian accent very well. Sometimes I am amazed by how well it picks up stuff. 6. Kids love it. An added advantage is that they can take help for homework and talking to Alexa also motivates them to talk in English too.",0,5
453,Adil,2020-09-14,Amazon - best service ever,"Actually ,earlier it did not recognise my voice and I thought it is a device manufacturing issue but one thing I realised is that Amazon is far far better then any e- commerce company currently present in India. I mean I had put a bad review considering the unknowning fact about its language change in the device which I was not aware. I got a call from  Ireland call centre asking me about the issue and trust me guys I am really IMPRESSED by the way, Amazon customer service representatives handled the issue. So, to all who face an issue with regards to voice recognition in the particular device can request for help through customer care and you will be amazed with the help and later usage.From now I am a Amazon user, Bye Bye Flipkart-!!",0,5

But my suggestion is the people who are looking to or having a SMART HOME like everything in your house is automated with Voice command it's good for you. And for the normal houses it's just act like a Bluetooth Speaker that's it somewhere around in a corner laying in your house. If you want to BUY it first convert your house like smart bulbs, tubelights, android TV, remote enabled fans, Ac's. Normal houses just a speaker that you can talk when bored for entertainment.",0,5
455,Ameesh Bisaria,2019-10-16,"Decent quality, nice improvisation over time, connectivity to speakers should improve","Alexa at first looks nice to use as you see diiferent skills/ activities it can perform. Eventually you get used to it or you stop using it i mean you get bored of what it does. I would like to see better integration with equipments, for me i have connected smart light which is working perfect but it is just not able to add or find my Bose speakers, that is a downsidr. They have to improve connectivity.I liked the fact they quite frequently update Alexa understanding power recently they added Hindi to Alexa. Otherwise also i have seen the Alexa improvising on its data.Speaker quality is not too impressive but good decent quality at this price point.Overall I am happy with this just make sure that you buy if you want to integrate it in your daily routine otherwise it will be just lying on the side.",0,4

Able to answer basics questions easily but sometimes it's not able to search on Google and it will then reply by saying "" o don't know that.4. Good sound quality ( really good Bass )5. At the price of 2000 INR.  It's a good speaker as comparison to others. So don't wait more thinking to buy or not. Just order it and enjoy the Amazon Alexa.6. One thing should be needed is that it's connectivity from Google or any other sear h engine. So that it can search over that and can find easly the answer of any question ask by the user.7.

It takes longer than usual to reach Imphal even tho I have a prime membership, on top of that, you're selling us defected products. Shameful.

Coupled with Amazon music its a great way to pass the time.The skills lists are limited but I think as popularity grows so will the skills catalog.This product will become more powerful and useful as time goes on in terms of home automation.I highly recommend you avoid the older version of the echo dot.
