0,0,0,0,Arshad Irfan,2020-11-09,"They are very good, I highly recommend them.","This is a genuine review and tested it for 2 complete days.Pros:- Battery life is good 3-4 hours with buds and around 12 additional hours with case. But should not expect this much backup of you are using volume above 80%- Fits good in ears however, it depends on the ear size and shape of an individual also.- The buds do not fall down during any work or workout. Did not try them while jogging/running though.- Noise cancellation for calls is decent, even when it is not promised primarily. I spoke over a call for 3 hours and the call quality is good.Cons:- Volume levels are high, but not very high. With some Youtube videos, the volume levels will not be enough if you are in crowd.- Bass is average, cannot have high expectations. These are not in-ear buds, hence, you'll feel the bass is low.- due to smooth finish and improper shape of buds, it is difficult to take out the buds if your hands/fingers are big. They are also slippery.- Touch controls are not so easy to navigate and sometimes I should repeat the command twice or thrice to get them working. Maybe I'm not much habituated to this.- Touch commands are also different from other Noise/ear buds products, so getting confused when using them.- When adjusting the ear bud, the long tap on the bud activates Google Assistance unnecessarily.Overall, the buds are too good for this price range. I don't think you should expect anything more for this deal.Edit 1: After 6 months of usage. (June 2021)- The buds sometimes connect to the phone even when they are placed inside the charging case. I will be connected to a Bluetooth speaker and these buds connect out of nowhere and the music playing will be interrupted and changed to the buds immediately. At those times, I will have to mark the buds as forget device and then continue playing the music from speakers. This has become a headache. I feel like giving 1 star for this.- The white LED lights on each earbud and the charging case light are almost invisible in the daylight or under the sun.",588,3,0,0,0

Though it if of plastic made it does give a premium look.Connecting didn't have any problem it immediately detected and paired voice was good, but fitting in the Airbuds seems to be a problem of course it is limited to me don't know how it goes with others but it will problems for sure. Since I am more of BASS LOVERS, expected a bit since it has got 16 mm, didn't get heavy bass so I strictly recommend not for music lovers especially for BASS LOVERS.

Find out why below:1. Touch controls to raise volume, pause next or previous song --> Not smooth, you need to repeatedly do it.2. Sound quality --> It's just okay for music and videos. But when it comes to calling, you might be able to hear the voice of the other person. BUT your voice will not be clear to the other person.3. Connectivity --> As soon as you move away from your phone, only 2-3 feet (WITHOUT ANY WALLS in between) then also voice distortion starts. so not so truly wireless when you have voice distortion when moving away from your phone.One line for review --> Don't waste your money here.

Don't expect much for bass but overall it's quite good for the price.EDIT: So it's veen around 2 months since I bought this airbuds and oh do I have a story. The volume in the left one became considerably low so I sent it for replacement (which took 13+ damned days). The replacement unit is another faulty one with despicable battery performance. So, I RETURN IT AGAIN(2ND TIME) and I get a good unit(or so it seemed). After 4 days with the unit, the left one is again gone very quiet so I'll have to replace again. I hoped I got a refund but the money is stuck now. Do yourself and your wallet a HUGE favour and DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT or any notice product at all.Edit 2: I'm on my 4th return now,and the problem still persists. DO NOT BUY LITERALLY ANYTHING FROM NOISE. Their official website has inflated reviews and almost all products of theirs have problems like mine. Its literally a scam company and please don't fall for ANY of their products. Just do yourself a favour and ignore their products so that this company drowns out of existence.",5,1,0,0,0
26,26,26,26,Girish A.,2020-11-11,Value for money under 2k,"Using this bud for past 2 days. I find it good and value for money under 2k if you are lucky to get a non defective piece.They fit well in ear. Mic is good. There is passive noise cancellation so don't expect much. Touch controls are good but work with a bit of delay.Coming on to the sound, if you like strong bass then these buds are not for you. They give crips and clear output which can be optimised using Dolby Atmos.Battery backup is quite good. Case is super delicate need to be very cautious with it.My right bud have some issue. After battery drops 60% or below it give buzzzzz sound when nothing is playing which is annoying.Edit 1 (22Nov2020): It is now 2 weeks I am using these earbuds. Here is a quick review:Overall rating: 4/5Build quality of case and buds: 4/5Battery life: 4/5Sound quality: 4/5Noise cancellation: 3.5/5Touch gesture: 4/5Customer support: 4.5/5I liked the crips and clear sound. It have 13mm driver but still misses on thumping bass. Don't get me wrong overall they have quite balance sound. One last improvement area - making touch gesture respond fast.Before I close my review, I must say Noise customer support is quite responsive. They do follow up on call, emails, and whats app. Quite happy with the support I received with my faulty buds.Overall I am satisfied with the product at the price I got it.

I brought 2 products (for myself and my better half). The voice clarity is also good. There is good background noise cancellation as well.  The only challenge is there is no instruction manual. One has to google to understand the working of pause/sound up-down.Paring with mobile is very simple. It takes less than 5 seconds. Similarly paring with laptop/desktop is seamless.

And other than that my boice comes muffled to others.Battery life is okay. Built quality is okay. Earbud protrusion is too big but surprisingly stable.My main reason was buying this for calls and it has underperformed. I have noise shots as well, though a little pricey but still better. Even one plus buds are great though slightly more expensive.End comment : No go for calls whatsoever. The absolute worst. Okayish for music.

48,48,48,48,Anushk johri,2021-02-12,Read this before buying!! (With images),I have been using these for 2-3 days now firstly I would like to mention things it does good.- Premium look- Battery backup- Pairing to devices is quick and easy- type C charging- build quality- Touch controls (but it has some draw backs)Now talking about the things they could’ve done better.1. The design of the case. It’s relatively tough to open the case with one hand.2. The fit of the pods. As an apple user I enjoy the pods shape design for earbuds but go noise for some reason made them angled and slightly thicker due to which it’s not very comfortable. I have to keep readjusting them.3. Takes too much time to summon the assistant. While the touch response is fairly decent for most of the actions such as play pause etc. but when you try to command your voice assistant it makes a pop sound and then 1-2 second later it gets connected to siri.4. Microphone doesn’t have noise cancellation. It has two mics they get the job done but don’t expect high quality in this range.,2,3,0,0,0

This airbuds does the thing perfectly,only issue is the sound which I hear is not very loud. The airbuds are working fine for WFM scenarios but places with loud background noise like in the streets may cause problems. Overall I am satisfied with product.Editing the review after 2 months of use: I am reducing the stars as it doesn’t serve my main purpose of taking calls in laptop or mobile. The main issue is non availability of background noise cancellation. As this airbuds doesn’t have the feature , and a powerful mike small noises like fan movement and even the breeze gets captured and the opposite person doesn’t able to hear my voice. Other than this everything is working superbly like music , connectivity,battery standby. It doesn’t fall off even when I am running with wearing the airbuds.",0,3,0,0,0

Bluetooth 5.0 and USB-C type charging were one of my key deciding factors. The touch interface sometimes do not function as expected, however, I would expect nothing better at this cost and if you are searching for a budget TWS earbuds Noise Air Buds are definitely a good option.6 Month Review:The touch on one ear bud completely stopped working. The sound profile wasn't great to start with and after having listened to certain good earbuds like Jabra Elite 75t Activ this sounded like absolute crap. Worst part is, procedure to claim warranty through support is horrible and I had this exchanged in Flipkart when they were still functional and was connected to at least one device before fear of it to completely stop working. Why fear? Requires the touch to work to engage pairing mode.",0,2,0,0,0

I have got multiple complaints from people saying that they are not able to hear my voice and can only hear the surrounding sounds.

91,91,91,91,Suriya,2021-04-24,Very Worthy for this rate,Hi guys I bought this on 12 April 2021 so till this day I am reviewing this product actually the bass quality was up to the level like all half ear earbuds star value I am giving 4/5 for bass and next thing the product feels so solid and fits in the ear so good for fitting i will surely give 5/5 and vocals where so clear and if u keep max sound u will be just get into it so powerfull sound so for sound I will surely give 5/5 at last about battery I have used this continuously for 2 hours playing all the songs fully in my phone I took the earbud in 100% charge and after 2hours of playing there was still 80% charge remaining I was amazed so for battery quality I will give 5/5 and it feels light in ear and there is no pain in ears tooo......I was just amazed so if u r trying to buy a tws for 2500 u may surely go to this last but not the least the touch controls are responding good but with small lag that u can feel it when using and during gaming I did not face any lag it was good but not so accurate so u may surely go for this and this is a premium buds too....build quality was also too good.....feels good all over.

101,101,101,101,Anand Dova,2021-02-24,It's really good and recommendable to everyone.,"I am using these air buds for more than a month and my honest reviews.Pros:- Battery life is good 4-5 hours with buds and around 12 additional hours with the case. But you should not expect this much backup if you are using volume above 80% in few apps that might sound low and the rest might feel very high volume depends.Fits good in-ears however, it depends on the ear size and shape of an individual also. mine was not adjustable in the initial time later got it how to use it.The buds sometimes fall down during any work or workout. but only when you are a new user of this later it won't fall down. Did not try them while jogging/running though.- Noise cancellation for calls is decent, even when it is not promised primarily. I spoke over a call for 2 hours and the call quality is amazing.Cons:- Volume levels are high, but not much very high. With some Youtube videos, the volume levels will not be enough if you are in-crowd. also, you have to take care of buds in the crowded area so that they might not fall down else you won't get back.- Initially, touch controls are not so easy to navigate, and sometimes I should repeat the command twice or thrice to get them working. Maybe I'm not much habituated to this. Even I got pain a lot while using for movies or sports hours an hours it gives pain to my left ear.- When adjusting the earbud, then a long tap on the bud activates automatically Google Assistance unnecessarily.Overall, the buds are too good for this price range. I don't think you should expect anything more from this deal. Go for it.",0,4,0,0,0
102,102,102,102,Rashmi,2021-04-20,Unreliable,"Edit: Within a month, the left bud started to suffer in volume, it was much quieter than the right one. I raised a complaint with Noise, got a replacement within 10 days I think. Then, the same issue reoccurred in the replacement air buds, starting few days ago. It has been picked up again, and I'm yet to receive a replacement unit. Additionally, during phone calls I have received complains that I'm not audible. On testing I found that the microphone is only in the left bud, not in the right one. So holding the left bud close to mouth solves that issue, but that is hardly the right way to use it. Overall, would not recommend.Original review: It pretty much works as advertised. It is comfortable to wear, doesn't fall off easily. Due to the shape, it doesn't have much off a noise cancellation or bass, but that is fine by me. For taking calls, microphone works fine, and I never heard any complaints about background noise. While using with laptop it sometimes has audio drop for a split second. Not sure if that is an issue with the earphones or the laptop, but it's not bad enough to be an issue.",0,2,0,0,0

118,118,118,118,Yash,2021-03-17,NOISE has made GOOD NOISE,"Ok about this product .. I think it's a brilliant product .. everything about this is very good .. I was pretty anxious before buying this but I guess it was the right choice ..Sound -Highs and Mids : Simply amazing and super clearLows or Bass : For a normal person this bass is more than enough and he/she will love them but if a musician, then the bass could have had been a little more .. although it is a lot already.Built Quality:Very Firm and luxurious quality in this budget .. a sweet briefcase like egg shaped casing with beautiful earsets.Comfort:Fits in appropriately and stays inside and specially even if you are a heavyweight person .. if you try to touch your cheek to your shoulder .. the normal pods usually pop out or fall down but this earpiece gets brilliantly adjusted and stays within though at times you may feel that they are a bit loose but they stay within the ear and do not fall out. At times when you press them in your ear for a more firm grip the bass quality increases and it sounds more better for Bass lovers.Charging and controls:Charging is great .. for the specifics read the number of hours but as I have been using them since last 2 weeks I have charged them only twice with almost 3 to 5 hrs usage in one day and charging takes 50 mins for full charge.From controls perspective if you need something very organised and clear like plus minus volume button and one single button for functionality then these may seem a bit finicky to you as the touch bit has pattern function- one touch two touch etc but if you're a science student who loves complications then these controls are for you plus you have to make sure that while adjusting these headphones in your ear hold them from the bottom so that it does not interfere with the touch function cz that gets annoying at a later stage.Call Range and Quality:Has a great range as mentioned and within that range the call quality is great and the individual on the receiving end can also hear you whispering on these.Noise Cancellation:Ofcourse they do not cancel the external voice completely like the In-Ear buds but that is what I needed as I don't feel comfortable in them and this was exactly what I was looking for and it does involve some external voice so that even while listening to music you can hear your mom shouting your name or the door bell but not when the volume is full or a level below full which is again a good thing in this product.Overall feedback : A Great product from my point of view and in their next update they should add more bass for the musicians out there.

Connectivity with Windows 10, Android and iOS is really easy and fast. It reconnects from one device to another device very fast and smoothly.2. Sound quality is very good. Even for music streaming through Spotify and other apps, I found it to be of good quality and Bass is also decent though not that high.3. I have used it for attending meetings from Zoom, MS Teams in both laptop and mobile. I must say this has been really satisfactory. Even the range is also good which is helpful when attending office meetings as you can move from your place to a decent distance without any interruption.4. Battery Backup is excellent & very satisfactory. Lasts for almost 3-4 hours depending on the usage of video or only audio. Charging time is also very minimal. 100% recharge can be done is almost 30 minutes.5. Pausing songs is very effective with the tap even from a decent range. Tried to pause songs on Spotify in laptop using airbuds and it works smoothly.Only one Cons I as far as my review is concerned:1. Controlling with touch on the air buds is difficult and very sensitive.. You should know exactly  where to tap for volume increase/decrease, pause any song or for next songs.***** Overall I can say, this is a very good air bud within this price range.

Cannot say if it's better than the rest in market. But I could hear SFX audios very well.And, donot use it on full volume it will have adverse effects on your ears moreover full volume use results in discharging the air buds quickly.  70% volume is enough to make it last upto 2.5-3 hours with some breaks. After that put it in the case to charge again. Once full charged, case gives additional four times recharging to your ear buds in my use yet. However, I haven't used it to the fullest of its potential(I haven't noted exact charge times however they maybe more, but works for you). Quite fine by me.Fit: It fits well, well for a light jog and jumps, but if you run like a Gorilla you may loose it.Touch: It is good if you accidentally touch it will respond to that, will take some time to get accustomed to the volume adjustments.Sometimes it can irritate you in the ear if you wear it for longer periods which is because it says you should take some rest from the ear buds (free your ear).Noise cancellation is okay, I didn't notice in detail.(Photos isn't Attached because I don't want to matches the same.

After facing the said issue, I went to the Karol bagh service centre, they apparently took 7 days to diagnose and rectify the issue and also promised to replace it with a new product. But it till date I am facing the same issue and I don't think they have replaced with the new piece. If they have replaced with a new piece then all their products are defective.

Bass is best which you can expect from ""Half in-ear type"" ear piece(If you want perfect bass go for Silicon bud type).Noise cancellation gets the job done with phone calls,no distortion🤗.Overall a affordable and quality product from Noise.Though it's a Half in-ear type model,it brings best out of it & No Doubt in it👍",0,4,0,0,0

If there’s lots of background noise, you may have difficult hearing through your ear buds.Con: Hearing LossSome studies warn that ear buds contribute to hearing loss more than other headphones. That’s because you have to crank the volume higher, since there’s no noise cancellation.Con: Poor Bass ResponseIt’s hard to get big sound out of a little device, and that’s particularly true with ear buds.",0,4,0,0,0
