But worked on MI 4c pro Smart TV. The Amazon Customer Support mentioned that TV's from 2014-2015 supports Fire Stick but mine was 2016 Model. Before Purchasing, please see whether your LED TV (Not a Smart TV) works or not by using your friends or family and then purchase. The HDMI Port was properly works for Airtel DTH.The below request is for Amazon. Please specify the TV and their model with year for customer reference which can be used before purchasing.",1375,1,0
1,1,1,Rajesh Kumar,2020-10-16,Good thing comes in small packages :),"I have a 4k stick and I was in love with it. So, bought this for my projector where I don't need power /volume buttons as my projector can't be controlled using the remote.Ordered immediately as it was available. Got it on same day evening. Love you Amazon for quick delivery.Product. Initial impression.Plug in, connect, everything is done by them. Tried pairing with 4k remote and works. It's smooth UI as good or better compared to 4k. Didn't feel the lag which was felt with full hd stick (previous version).With in 10 minutes, started watching IPL. 5.1 support.If you are looking to buy for a TV, please go for the remote with power/volume buttons. If you're looking to connect to monitor, projector etc, go for the lite version.Dolby Atmos I couldn't try as I don't have that. Dolby digital Plus working without any issues.Over all a great buy. No comparison need with Mi stick as its no where near to this.Happy viewing",400,5,0
2,2,2,Avi,2020-10-18,Amazing but could be better,"This stick is amazing in every way possible except for the fact it's has limited streaming quality settings The only options it provides are hd and full hd unlike the good, better, best options in the browser or app. Also these settings do not affect the quality of stream on the other apps. You have to set the streaming quality in each app separately for example, youtube, hotstar, voot, etc.Quality of remote does not feel up-to the mark. The battery flap moves a little every-time you grab the remote.There are a few things missing currently which can make this stick even better:-1) volume normalization,2) Equalizer settings3) Ability to download at-least prime video content and view offline.4) Option to show and search only the content which we have access to. Its a waste of time when you search for a movie and it opens it in the app you don't have subscription to.Still amazing device overall at an amazing price.",382,5,0

5,5,5,Gunjan Gupta,2020-10-17,Same hardware as Firetvstick 2020 and Firetvstick 4K in lesser price.,"I had an older version of firetvstick and also have firetvstick 4k. I was thinking to upgrade my older firetvstick to a newer version and hence have bought the lite version as its the same hardware as the firetvstick 2020 and firetvstick 4k i.e. all of them uses the same processor from mediatek. Both lite and 2020 editions have 1 GB of ram, while the 4K edition has 1.5 gb of ram. Both 2020and lite edition has 4K disabled, but as I dont have a 4K tv and most likely will not buy one for next 5 years, it doesnt really matter to me.The lite edition comes with the lite version of the remote i.e. the remote will not have the power and volume button for the tv.For me there is one downside though. The devices actually comes Fire OS 7 with Android Security Patch level as 05 October 2018 based on Android Pie, which is quite old. The older Fire OS 6 that comes in the 4K edition has a newer security patch level of late 2019 (forgot the exact value) even though that is based on Android 7",49,5,0

Only difference is that this version does not include TV controls like volume button, but then you already have a TV remote to control volume. It's been a week since I've been using it and I'm in love with it. You can download apps and stores and browse through internet too. It made my TV a smart TV now, haha.

24,24,24,Raj Giri,2020-11-11,Good but not the best like Android TV stick,"Everything is awesome sound and picture quality both improved from normal tv but I need to highlight few cons of this product:1. It has separate LIVE TV CHANNELS SECTION, when you click on it, it extracts all the live channels from all the available apps like Voot etc (but u should have premium subscription of that app). I have Prime, Voot, Zee5 premium subscription but ZEE5 live tv channels aren't available on live tv section. Then OBVIOUSLY THERE'S NO USE OF LIVE TV CHANNELS OPTION IF IT CAN'T EXTRACT ALL THE CHANNELS FROM PREMIUM APPS.2.If you directly go to homepage from on going app and open other app then opened new app starts lagging. May be this is due to 1gb of RAM.3. In android tv u have a option of voice control on your keyboard. Means you don't have to type anything in the app. You just have to click on voice and say n it will write for you whatever you say in the app. But this FEATURE IS MISSING IN FIRE TV STICK. I searched for other keyboard but this option is not available.4. If you want to use THOP TV or OREO TV then guys it will not show you the logo of these apps. Here logo will be blank which looks very bad. And the channels you open on these two apps have not that good quality which can be seen on proper smart android tv. Thop tv and oreo tv channels quality is awesome on my other Smart tv that means these two apps are having issues in Fire tv stick only.5. Voice response must be in hindi and english both. I wanted everything in English written but alexa response on both hindi and english.(the language u ask, alexa must answer in that language)...I hope all these features mentioned above by me above will be resolved in next updates then it will 5 star rated product and I will change my rating from 3 to 5.",7,3,0

26,26,26,Gaurav Kumar,2020-10-28,Everything is perfect but two things are very bad...,"First of all the biggest drawback is that you cannot cast videos from your mobile app like hotstar,zee5,mx player etc to any fire stick,you can only cast videos from youtube and i talked to fire stick company and they told me that after new uprade you will also not be able to cast videos from youtube also.Another drawback is its remote because it doesn't have volume key which is very important but there is a solution also for this problem is that you can buy standard version of fire stick...Except these the user interface is excellent...and every thing is perfect....Screen Mirroring is also very nice....If you don't use screen casting and you can use tv remote every time for volume control then you can go for it without any doubt.If you want screen casting and use single remote then you should go for standard version for single remote and if you want both then go for mi stick....",7,3,0

29,29,29,MJ,2020-10-22,Blindly Go for it when your budget is 2k.,"It is the best in the market at this price segment. We know that it doesn't have volume control with remote, but Amazon should understand the need of voice controlled remote & provide us the same, i.e, for example - Alexa, decrease/increase or lower the volume then by default 10% vol. Decreases... With that feature added with software update, I'm sure it's gonna change the way we watch tv.Amazon is purely taking advantage of the consumer setiments by triggering the need of volume control by button/voice assistant. Hence asking them to pay more. At this price specially those who are buying this product are saving 500 bucks only for volume controls as there is no difference between the main version and the lite one other than volume controls.Hoping, with the update they bring voice control of volume atleast.Personally i loved the FIRE OS, lag free and definitely smoother than Android OS.Ram management looks good, cache memory occupies much storage so please go and manually clear apps' cache after use.On this latest version i see they have removed many apps from appstore which is not good. Anyways you can sideload many apps by watching youtube videos.Some of them finding difficult it to install, but it's really easy if you have cleared your board exams you should atleast know this.At around 2k range, just go for this one. I hope it works well for 2 years atleast with decent usage.",6,5,0

Firestick is supporting all the major apps like primevideo, netflix, hotstar, sonyliv, voot, zee5, youtube, youtube kids, xstream, dissovery plus etc plus mirroring from mobile/laptop. It is supporting LIVE channels from Apps like sonyliv & voot.

Usually installing the app doesnt take much time so this is not at all a big problem.Even though the remote makes use of IR blaster for volume control and switch off tv, it is really powerful it doesn't need to be in a straight line of sight with the tv for operation.Firestick also pairs with my echo dot and works well with the alexa remote as well.

Lite version is definitely a inconvenience to those who don't want to keep tv remote close by. I thought voice command Alexa can be used to toggle volume but that doesn't work (it denies). Apps are certainly more than older version I used and if you have a good internet connection then things will be smooth however. It consumes more bandwidth given the HD quality streaming.

In 1.5 Gb we can see a HD movie and few SD songs what more we want from that.Earlier version needs very high speed data even to load the home screen but this does it like a magic with mobile hotspot.While using mobile hotspot do not forget to make sure that your mobile is charged above 30% and immediately connect to a charger and place where it gets good signal and ventilation to both sides of your mobile.  Else get a wireless hotspot from airtel/jio, even it has to be connected to a charger while watching HD movie.Overall a worthy product made me to get theatre experience at home . Fire tv with alexa can open many other applications like timer and weather and local news which an android tv don't do.Do not forget to switch off the power supply after using fire stick as it may damage your fire tv stick and void warranty",2,5,0

Volume and power key is not there in lite version but you can control that through your home theatre remote.Bluetooth connectivity is good. I have connected both remote and tower speakers. Wifi bandwidth is also good. It catches up my neighborhood wifi alsoüòú. Overall i enjoyed its features. I would definitely recommend this for everyone.

I'm using the tv control remote from that one and works just like the full version, it was delivered on 14th of October (1 day before the official launch). Performance is quite improved from old one. And After the price drop during the sale Amazon decided to issue 1000rs cashback for the people who pre-ordered this,So the effective price is only 1999, and you're getting very good performance, Certified streaming of Netflix, Prime and all other apps that require widevine certification and if you use the Alexa voice remote from your old stick you get the full functionality.Strongly recommend for this price range",3,5,0

46,46,46,Aryan Singh,2020-11-08,Good but needs improvement.,"It‚Äôs a great device for those who don‚Äôt have good smart TV.I ordered Lite version because Fire Stick was not in stock, so I went with Lite version.The only difference between them is of Volume buttons on Alexa Remote, which was of no concern to me.You can also control your FireStick with your TV remote as well.PICTURE QUALITY:-Now coming to the product, it‚Äôs good device the picture quality is amazing, I could not notice any lack of detail in Picture quality while streaming in any app.DISSAPOIMTMENTS:-Only thing that disappointed me is Alexa. It‚Äôs not as smart as you would think.I have one Echo too and Alexa in Echo is much smarter than Alexa in Fire Stick.You can‚Äôt say ‚Äúsearch for xyz on YouTube‚Äù to do a search on YouTube from home screen.First you have to say ‚ÄúOpen YouTube‚Äù then say ‚ÄúSearch for XYZ om YouTube‚Äù.Bixby of my Samsung TV could do that easily.Fire Stick needs a lot of improvement in Alexa department.Also Audio is not loud at full blast. On Watching YouTube with FireStick, audio is not as loud as TV‚Äôs native YouTube app.PROS:-Except for that everything is awesome.Responsiveness is superb, no lag whatsoever.App opens instantly as if it‚Äôs waiting in RAM to be opened, perhaps this is because I have high speed broadband connection.You also have NDTV app both English & Hindi which is free of cost (not subscription based). You can also watch IPL in Hotstar but I think Fire Stick doesn‚Äôt support 120 Hz refresh rate.When I used to watch Cricket directly from TataSky on my SONY TV the motion was very smooth almost like realtime. But on watching IPL from Hotstar that smoothness can‚Äôt be felt, perhaps this is because of Hotstar broadcasting limit. I think they don‚Äôt broadcast IPL in high refresh rate. I don‚Äôt know who‚Äôs is to blame for this.But on watching movie I can feel smoothness in helicopter shots, so I think it‚Äôs the Hotstar fault.BUILD QUALITY:-Build quality is OK but I am concerned about long term reliability of the stick, since it always lies behind TV with no ventilation and stick heats up while playing games.Will update the review if any problem occurs.One thing I would like to suggest to Amazon Fire Stick developers is that ‚ÄúPlease add more apps‚Äù, right now there is no Spotify app for Firestick. I could not find any way to add Spotify in Fire Stick.OPINION:-I think it‚Äôs a great device and justifies its price.Anyone who has outdated TV and want to stream online content should buy this with eyes closed.Even people who have smartTV should get this, because processors in this is much faster than on TV. Apps opens instantly while on my  2014 SONY TV app used to take a lot of time to open. So overall experience was not that nice.I am satisfied with my purchase and I hope that Alexa will improve in coming years.I bought it for 2099‚Çπ.",2,4,0

I own a 10 year old Sony Bravia LCD TV (has hdmi ports though) and I was told that amazon fire stick works only on tv models that are manufactured after 2015 or on tv models that is HDCP compliant. Generally TV manufactured after 2015 are by default HDCP compliant. But to my belief when i plugged in the firestick to the hdmi port with the help of hdmi extender provided inside, it worked flawlessly. After the initial software update and remote pairing everything  is working fine. If you have a strong wifi connection there is no lag observed and all the content can be viewed clearly. Now our old LCD tv has become a Smart TV. Hope this review is helpful for all who has a doubt regarding the device compatiblity.",2,5,0

  This is potentially a 5 star product. Taking 1 star away for unavailability of various apps including YouTube and Netflix. But you can always use the browser for that.Taking another star away for not including the TV controls and charging customers exorbitant markup for including those options in the Fire TV stick. I am not going to pay so much extra just to have volume and power control.It is nevertheless a grave inconvenience to have to reach out for the TV remote to change the volume or turn on and off the TV.The fire TV stick rocks!

Not only does it include pretty much all streaming apps that you can think of, its very fast to connect (my tv takes like ages to connect to the internet after turning it on), plus the ability to search for titles across apps is amazing! I no longer have to worry about which movie/series is on which platform, all i do is speak on the remote and the app shows all info about that title instantly and lets me connect to the app directly from the search results.. it literally has elevated my streaming experience to another level! Now i dont feel like streaming anything on my smart tv as its so slow and cumbersome in comparison. Also the ability to use voice search makes things very easy and fast, typing on the tv remote is a very time-consuming process! Another thing, believe it or not, due to my not-so-reliable internet connection, my tv streaming used to get paused (buffering) at times, but i dont find the same problem as much using fire-tv stick, i think whatever hardware they use for networking is pretty good at maintaining connectivity with my wifi router.

Performance is really amazing, even I couldn't believe the performance. Yesterday morning (26/08/21), I placed the order for the Fire stick lite under the prime member's offer in the morning and got the Firestick lite delivered before 7pm.  I tried to install it by around 0745 am on 27/08. I had couple of issues on the installation. I contacted Amazon customer care, they transferred my call to the concerned fire TV section and I was assisted by one of their lady representatives for installation and she was ready to clear all my doubts in installation by sharing my TV screen with her. Finally I was totally successful in installation. Hats off to the concerned staff, she was ready and happy to clear all my doubts in installation. I was feeling sorry for my self, why I didn't bother to buy a fire TV stick till date.  I never expected to upgrade my 11 year plasma TV to the status of a smart TV. During Last Diwali sales, I bought a 55 inch Kodak smart LCD TV, but the performance of my LG plasma TV is any time better than the Kodak smart TV, with the fire TV stick.

60,60,60,Sandeep,2021-06-20,Good Streaming device with some annoying shortcomings,"A decent streaming device for the price with some annoying cons (listed below):1. Voice recognition/command function is is a work in progress and i give it 5/10. It provides correct results only half of the times. Voice functionality is not fully integrated into the firestick and and it only performs a limited set of comands. It fails to open most the apps installed externally and even many appa from the amazon market.2. Lack of volume buttons and power on off buttons is simply IDIOTIC on Amazon's part.  Only way to switch off is unplugging the power adaptor and thia frequently leads to firestick getting stuck in boot loop during start and blank display. I have to reset my tv once everyday to make it work and its pathetic.3. The inbuilt Android ROM has limited support to external apps and icons don't show up in the launcher.4. Some native apps like zee5 keep getting corrupted and live TV channels fail to sync.5. 90% of the user interface has is occupied by advertisement of Amazon' shows and there is no way to customize the look. The GUI is not very user friendly or intuitive. Overall very little customisation is available in fire stick.PROS:1. Streaming quality is good and remains stable even at slow internet connections. My firestick performs well at 10MBPS connection that tops at 2.5 MBPS download speed on an average (roughly 10% of connection rating). The stick automatically adjusts quality as network fluctuates2. Firestick feels snappy compared to similar specced (1GB RAM, Quadcore processor) android TV sticks like Mi, Nokia & MarQ. Android should optimze is more to make it fast.3.

64,64,64,Aaqib,2021-06-06,The Best Video Streaming Device for Indian Market,"Firstly, I was confused with the decision to buy Fire TV Stick Lite or Mi TV Stick. After reading the reviews and watching few relevant videos online, I went for the Fire TV Stick Lite. I must say that I took the best device for my TV. I am using Fire TV Stick Lite for my old Onida HD TV (not full HD). The setup was very simple and UI is smooth and intuitive. All the apps such as Prime Video, Netflix, Hotstar, Zee5, YouTube etc work smoothly like a breeze.There's a great collection of apps in the app store. It works well with mobile internet (4G) but it works best with WiFi. If you are using mobile internet, then select 5 GHz bandwidth in hotspot settings (I used Redmi phone for this).There's no difference in terms of specifications between Fire TV Stick and Fire TV Stick Lite. The remote is better in Fire TV Stick with volume control and power on/off for TV.It's a really good device.Important: This point may help few to make the correct decision while buying. There's a small difference between Fire TV Stick Lite & Mi TV Stick. Mi TV has 'Screen cast' which is very useful in casting any supported app while using the mobile in background for any other task. The mobile screen can be locked after casting and the playback/activity will continue on TV. Controls such as volume and resolution settings can be changed on mobile. Whereas Fire TV Stick Lite and Fire TV Stick has 'Screen Mirroring'. With this feature, the mobile screen is exactly shown on the TV screen and can be operated to display/show pictures and videos to family and friends.Out of 'Screen Cast' and 'Screen Mirroring', I feel 'Screen Cast' is better. But please read more about this to understand the differences to make your decision.Side Note: I have used and operated Mi TV 32 inch at my friend's house for a very considerable amount of months. It's a good device undoubtedly. But the UI would lag a little sometimes and it is not as smooth as Fire TV UI. With one update, few apps weren't working properly (which was solved later with another update). Although the side note wasn't very important but it may be helpful for some people. I hope my review was helpful.",1,5,0

Good connection everything working fine except screen mirroring there is some lag during screencast. Thought buying mi stick but they don't provide batteries and HDMI extender as I need extender and fire is is better than Android 9 os on mi tv stick. Guys buy fire TV stick only . If u want volume controls spend 500 rs more and buy 3rd gen stick. Lite is also good. Super fast connectivity. It made my 6 old 19 inch Panasonic tv to smart TV.

I did not wanted to spend that much this time so I went for fire stick lite. And guess what, it's totally worth it! I had few apprehensions whether the lack of volume and power button will be inconvenient, but so far I haven't felt a need for them. FS lite is much faster then my original Fire stick and the new user interface is also great. The new fire stick is more intelligent and only shows content from the apps I've subscribed to. The live tv button is also a nice addition and you can access TV channels from all the paid apps you've subscribed.All in all, FS lite is a complete value for money device and in my opinion it's not worth to spend more just got volume and power button. If you don't want access to 4K content this is the fire stick you should buy.",0,5,0
