3,3,3,3,FrankyFfingFourFingers,2019-10-10,"for SD only content, this is more than enough.","Oh the choices we have these days. From HD ready to 4k, thanks to surplus cash in hand, zero interest EMI and Chinese manufacturing.And what do we have in hand? A few HD channels and majority of it in SD broadcast (mind it, the 4:3 vintage quality).  So when 576i source is amplified into full HD (not even 4k) in our large screen chinese imports(or Indian assembles), what we get is immersive, yet immensely dull rendering as you watch it from a distance. That's where 32"" tv comes handy. You gotta sit close, like 5-6 feet and that's the best compromise. Those who rely mainly on SD content, get this. The upscaling to HD screen is much better than in the other brands. Choice is between 'dull, large screen' vs 'small(32), crisp images'. I went for the latter.Yes, picture is sharp. Bright. Vivid. By that, i mean nothing life-like. Life is dull and boring, remember? We apply instagram filters to make it rich, it's the same here. You can dull it all down if you want in the settings. But yeah, the tv is a joy to watch.Much have been berated about the sound, I don't find room to complain anymore. The modern human want the most powerful car with the highest fuel efficiency. He seem to believe that he can get everything- use your brain for a while- a compact package would only give little room for the speakers, so how much loud can they really be? It is good for a bedroom or a small living room. There's lack of bass, but audio and music sounds much clear. There is also a clear voice mode.  Think of it as an expanded phone speaker- serves the purpose.There's ample smart apps and there's also a HDR mode even for non-HD content- not sure what it does to the picture, haven't tested enough.  Power consumption is a humble 45W (this at full backlight/contrast, will go down if you reduce it ) so you can run it on your home UPS all day. There's less heat from the back.TV starts within seconds and displays the hdmi input (dth box, in my case) which is so much of a + over the cheap android tvs.Pen drive plays hevc content too! That's a +. Of course, impeccable quality with HD and full HD content.Around 15k INR, what you get is a 50% higher priced LG than the TCL, Vu equivalent, but what you also get is the peace of mind of owning a brand that actually provides a warranty service. It's like buying a toyota. You would only realize the premium paid in the long term ownership. It's small, but it's a joy to watch.",184,5,0,0,0
4,4,4,4,Mrinmoy Kundu,2020-02-02,Good TV with a not so good sound,Good product. Costed me 13999. Great picture. Very avg sound.Pros:# Big IPS screen and amazing viewing angle.# Smart features are Okay. Webos is actually better architected compared to Android which never made for TVs. You need to understand but there are pros and cons.# 4GB available memory.# Conntivity to wifi is seamless. Dealing with text is very tricky.# LG installation done over a swiveling wall mount bracket so TV can be vertically adjusted.# Android based app on your smart phone can replace the TV remote and a big help navigating.# wifi remain connected when TV is on standby mode. So you can power it on from Android based remote app. So don't regret for bluetooth and magic remote.# there is a LAN ethernet port incase it's a need.# One configured it auto searches for input and displays the content from my AV set top box. No hassle for elderly members as they don't have to learn anything new.# Comes with latest Webos Firmware and will auto upgrade if it's configured accordingly.CONS@ Sound is disappointing. My 10 year old Sony Bravia 22 inch with 5 watt RMS output sounds better.@ YouTube app do not come out of the box. Not a cons but you need to download it.@ The inbuilt browser is very inefficient. I cannot still sign into Google account due to missing plug in support. Still researching.@ One is completely dependent ON LG for firmware and app updates. This is a big disadvantage.@ missing Bluetooth is a big drawback. But I don't complain due to its cost. Better to have less feature than having everything of low quality.@ installation team did a very shoddy job. Wall bracket is fixed with 3 screws instead of 4. Amazon did not help Inspite of notifying. So be present and check all these nitty gritties.Hope this helps.,100,4,0,0,0

20,20,20,20,Äkây,2019-12-15,Best In This Price Point,"This is a best buy by LG in this price point. So here's the overview:1. Picture: The picture quality is good with different option available. If you are using a set up box, then it would be better if you upgrade from SD to HD.2. Sound: The sound from the TV crisp and clear and 10W speakers are loud enough for your home. No need of buying additional soundbars or speakers.3. Smart Features: It is a WebOS TV and not an Android one therefore, inspite of 1GB RAM there are no lags while switching between apps. Connecting to WiFi and external sources are very easy and work very well. The internal storage here is around 500MB which is enough for normal use. The TV can be easily connected and controlled with LG TV Plus app with screen casting and content playing features ( wherein you can play photos, videos and music directly from your phone).4. Magic Remote: No magic remote is provided with so no magic remote means no voice input that means you literally have to type everything (which is a bit boring!!!).5. TV Apps: The TV comes with pre loaded apps such as Netflix, Hotstar, Amazon Prime, ErosNow, Hungama etc. Well there is no Youtube and Spotify but you can easily download them from LG content store. And you need to update all apps when you start for the first time. You can even uninstall pre loaded apps if you want.This is the best TV if you are just upgrading from your age old CRT's to LED TV, as there is no point in spending more money and buying a non smart LED TV.

42,42,42,42,Arun Joy,2021-08-25,Disappointed by LG,"I had bought a TV on 06/08/21 with serial no: B08DPLCM6T. It worked properly for two weeks and then the video was not available from the AV port. The technician had told that the video port had burned off due to a voltage surge from the set top box. He had showed the burned portion also. As per the warranty I understand that LG doesn't cover issues due to voltage surges. But then, I have been using televisions of other brands like Sony & Panasonic for long and no such issues had occurred while using the same set top box. But just after buying an LG TV, if it burns off then I have to wonder about the quality of the circuit board used by LG. It is possible that the issue occurred due to a faulty board and not a voltage surge. It is unfortunate LG doesn't cover such issues even during the warranty period even though it's only a 2 week old product. It has been a disappointing experience for me with LG and would not ever be buying or recommending an LG product again.",0,1,0,0,0
43,43,43,43,Anil Sahu,2021-04-07,TV unit is good but LG service has been disappointing. Finally I got the faulty TV unit replaced.,"I am writing this review after 2.5 months of use. Till the time it was running, i liked it. Although screen share from iPhone is a pain and i haven’t figured that out yet. But the other features are not that bad. But, a couple of weeks back, when i turned on my TV, the picture brightness was so dim that i could barely watch anything in the screen even in a pitch dark room with full brightness in the TV. A service person came next day and said the panel has to be replaced and he ordered the same on that same day. I was told that it would take 7-10days for the part to come but it has been a couple of weeks and they are saying that the part is not available now. I am simply amazed that if for a brand new TV, the part is not available, then what will happen if it is 2-3years old. I had a belief that LG provides the best service and i took AMC (extended warranty of 4 more years on top of the current 1yr warranty) but now i am starting to doubt LG’s service. I hope i get either the panel replaced or the TV unit asap and i will get my trust back on LG.2nd Edit- Finally after waiting 1.5months LG replaced the faulty TV unit with a new one.",2,3,0,0,0

61,61,61,61,Nevin,2020-12-10,LG TV at an affordable price with some compromises,"Ordered this kind of product(TV) for the first time on Amazon looking at the offers during Diwali. Was looking for a second tv for bedroom. Already own a 43 inch Lg smart tv purchased 4 yrs ago. Delivery was quick. LG installation happened within the prescribed time i.e the next day. Installation engineer arrived on scheduled time and Swivel telli wall mount(which is free) was done and features of the tv explained.Things noticed as of now after using more than 1 month :-Picture quality is the best, although refresh rate is 50hz (could have given 60hz), Picture quality, viewing angles is way better compared to the other competitors like mi, Thompson etc. I guess no one can beat Lg in this (except Samsung to some extent)Sound is good enough for down firing speakers (10w)along with DTS Virtual surround sound. Bigger rooms might require a sound bar if you are someone that wants a higher sound. Remote is basic (but has buttons for Netflix, Amazon prime, Zee5) not the latest one provided by competitors like mi,one plus.Internet connectivity is good and supports 5ghz Wifi band as well.RAM is 1gb and it can be felt while browsing web os (LG operating os) but it is not much issue. It is not running on Android so that massive app library of android is not there and also the storage is 4gb (App storage around 604mb). Personally I don't prefer too much apps and webos is the best when it comes to TV and has all the necessary apps like Netflix, Amazon prime, hotstar,Google Play movies app, zee5, Alt balaji (jiotv is not there).Bluetooth is not available and there is only one usb port. It has 2 HDMI ports.Why prefer an LG tv over other brands and on amazon- service available across all places.. I have seen people buy Thompson, tcl and other brands and then struggling with service issues, warranty- 3yrs during Diwali period and Amazon offers were enough to seal the deal. For all these and combine with the price this one is a steal. Would definitely recommend this to anyone going for a budget tv (32inch).",1,4,0,0,0

The viewing angles 178 degree is not accurate around 155 degree angle colurs start to fade. In our home window is exact infront of tv so the screen reflection is problem you can't see in normal day light so you have to install curtains. The sound quality is good for serial watching purpose but when you start to listen to music or movie you start to notice that the 20W speakers would be given. If you live in silent environment you Love the voice clearity when watching serials. As off screen mirroring I doesn't get any issues it works great. The OS is simple and easy to use.
