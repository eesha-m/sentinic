0,0,0,0,Somesh Saraf,2019-10-30,Quite disappointed!!,"Writing a review after few days of usage.It's quite good looking watch with list of features like sleep, heartrate, step monitor and many other. But what is the use of a feature if it is not accurate in measurements. This I realized when I went on a long drive in my car and it measured 14k steps when I got down only for few minutes!!!. Quite disappointed as I feel my daily goal achievements till now are not accurate. Probably I might be taking only 5k steps in my reported steps of 10k.I doubt about heartrate and sleep monitor also now. Did not expect this kind of flaw in version 2. Smart watches have been around for quite some time now and cannot expect such basic flaws now.More disappointed when I found a 2.5k MI 4 band works awesomely accurate than a 21k extravagant watch!!!

But apart from looks nothing great in this watch. Steps are counted incorrectly and believe me 140 steps covered while asleep. Floors were counted as 140 floors for a 35mins bike ride. Calories counted is something really soaring even while just sitting. For instance for about 64 steps,my calories burnt already showed 550.

Such a long wait for this watch and it doesn't do the job it's designed for. The app isn't that user friendly too.

Tried complaining on Twitter, etc, but they keep giving polite useless responses.Basically they won't commit on any date for shipping the replacement, So if you want to buy the expensive defective products of a company that doesn't care enough to have a replacement inventory in India while they still have inventory to sell, you may buy the Versa 2 or any other defective product from Fitbit.Good luck...!

So I am going to break it down to things that I had issues with:The accuracy - Absolutely off the mark. It counts every little movement as steps, driving distance, arm movements everything. Have not used any other fitness bands so I don't know if that is how it is suppose to work. But that was a big deal breaker for me personally.The display - I would 60% of the time it did not come on when I turned my wrist around and had to use the button on the side. Which again was weird.Alexa - 90% of the time it was disconnected and had to restart and re-sync the app for it to work.App - Not user friendly at all. The basic set up was ok but anything beyond that was confusing.I was finding myself only looking at the watch for the time since everything else seem to be giving so many issues and the inaccuracy was too much. Paying 22k to look at the time was ridiculous in my personal opinion.Don't splurge and go for the many other cheaper options that are available in the market today.

It has built-in Alexa and it's voice-enabled. It comes with 1 large and 1 small strap and a charger. Straps are easily available on any online shopping platform. You can store songs and play games by downloading them from the app on your mobile phone. The app has hundreds of clock faces. The clock faces can be downloaded from the app for free while some need to be paid for. It doesn't have a speaker but gets connected to earphones or headphones via Bluetooth. The battery life continues for 4-5 days depending upon the usage. It tracks all-day activity like steps, distance, active minutes, calories you burned. It measures your heart rate 24./7. Fitbit is water-resistant to some extent Bluetooth gets disconnected from the phone suddenly and you will not receive any message, mail, or phone calls. Sometimes it gets connected after 1-2 days. Fitbit is just a fitness tracker and should not be compared with other smart watches. It is advised to people who are fitness freaks. Overall the watch is worth the money.

72,72,72,72,Janaki V.,2021-09-18,Not even a year and it's pretty much stopped working,"I liked the step counter of this Fitbit and it looks really really chic and smart. But the calorie calculator is a scam. It shows you having burnt more than a 100 calories before you even wear the watch, how is that possible??

Go chk other sources of info. There is no dearth. Check Youtube, Check Google and you can even go to Fitbit Community in its App. Whatever I am saying, it's all true.This watch starts showing it's real colours after warranty is over or if you are lucky enough, then just before your warranty ends. I was lucky in this aspect. Still, being lucky is of no use, if you are in India.It stopped working abruptly one fine day. Screen is absolutely blank and never switching on again. I contacted the customer support, but he himself said that they are aware of the issue but they are still working on it. Fitbit is unable to find the reason and solution to this problem. There are millions facing this problem. Now, if you are in India, then you must know that there is no servicing facility in India by Fitbit. They just have centres. These centres collect the device, send it to US for repair and bring it back to you. To and fro transportation to these centres is your responsibility including the cost. So, hardly any use of the warranty.Think about it before spending your hard earned money.Feature wise, it's a awesome watch but it doesn't work for long.

I bought a Fitbit Versa for my sister last year after hearing mostly positive reviews. Below are the sequence of events post that.1. The charger stopped working after 3 days. Fitbit customer care was prompt and shipped a replacement charger which worked fine.2. After an year's use, recently the display of tbe watch stopped working. It went absolutely black. On contacting the fitbit customer care, I was told that since the watch was out of warranty they could not issue a replacement, which was fine by me. However the real kicker was when the lady told me that they don't repair our watches nor fitbit has any service centres across India or otherwise. She suggested me to buy a replacement watch as their was nothing that fitbit can do.Friends, I suggest you to kindly refrain from buying Fitbit products for as long as they don't have any service setup here in India. Any product is good till it lasts and if the company can't repair their own products then it's a serious issue for us customers.Regards

You know, i am really upset at this point since this is my second fitbit and both have had severe reliability issues. The first one broke a strap and guess what, you cant replace the strap since the device is part of the strap, talk of a good design. I was stupid to trust this **ahem** product again and buy a blaze this time. After spending close to 210$, and within precisely 1.5 years it stopped charging! First it broke a strap again. I bought a new strap. THen i suspected the charger, bought a new charger! None of those are the issues, the design is extremely poor and not at all worth the cost. I am an IC designer myself and i think these guys just make sure the circuits run past the 1 year reliability point because after that they arent responsible anymore. There are prdoucts available for 1/7 the cost and work more reliably. Please dont ever buy a fitbit product again, its lousy!

491,491,491,491,Arijit,2021-05-02,It's a steal now that it's on discount,"My Fitbit Versa 2 is, without any doubt, the best gadget I have ever purchased. I had many doubts while buying it, and there are a few things that don't work as well as I would like them to. But it has transformed the way I approach health and wellness, and helped me take care of myself better. But, all the above (and the rest of this review) are only applicable if it remains at the discounted price of 13-14k. :)PROS1. Excellent sleep tracking: my Fitbit taught me why I would spend a long night in bed yet wake up tired - I was just waking up a lot. It helped me set a bedtime schedule and I've been getting better and better sleep. You can read more about Fitbit's sleep tracking online, and most reviewers agree it's great at it.2. Excellent activity tracking: no smartwatch is 100% accurate, but Fitbit's heart rate and steps counters are right up there. If you're super-finicky and want it to count EXACTLY as many steps as you take, you may be disappointed by most smartwatches. But if you're like me who is trying to get more active through the day, this will do the job, especially with the active zone minutes feature. I've never been so regular with my workouts and been so active all day ever in my life, thanks to my Fitbit.3. Unmatched convenience: my Fitbit also helped me get more punctual and respect time, something I've been struggling with though the pandemic. Given the long battery life, I only need to charge in once every 4-5 days despite super-heavy use. It's very comfortable to wear, and looks good too!CONSThe biggest gripe would be from runners, as the Versa 2 does not have in-built GPS, so you would need to take your phone with you. But running in the pandemic isn't really feasible all the time. Moreover, I carry my phone even when I do go for an occasional run, so I don't have issues here. Additionally, some have complained about the lack of apps in the Fitbit store and a little less screen responsiveness, but most of these comparisons are with far more expensive smartwatches, and have never been a bother to me.CONCLUSIONExcellent sleep and activity tracking, and unmated comfort and convenience make my Fitbit Versa 2 a worthy companion in my quest to take better care of my health and mind. Ever since the Versa 3 came out, the Fitbit Versa 2 has been selling around 13-14k (I got it around 13.5), which makes it an absolute bargain and more than makes up for the few minor flaws it may appear to have.
