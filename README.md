Sentiment analysis is contextual mining of text which identifies and extracts subjective information in text, and helps a business to understand the social sentiment of their brand, product or service while monitoring online reviews. The reviews provided by the customers on e-commerce websites not only helps the owners to improve their services accordingly but also helps other customers to get an opinion of the products before buying them online. Our project was aimed at developing a web application to perform sentiment analysis on amazon product reviews by leveraging machine learning algorithms. We used SVM, Random Forest and Logistic Regression to train our model from which Logistic regression performed the best. We also implemented a web scraper using Beautiful Soup that gets real time reviews from amazon. The ML model was then used to predict the sentiment of each review which was displayed using interactive visualizations. With online shopping becoming the new trend this application is a one stop solution for business to track the popularity and sentiment of their product.
